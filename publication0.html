To stop the tuberculosis epidemic, it is critical that we interrupt tuberculosis transmission. Further, the interventions required to interrupt tuberculosis transmission must be targeted to high-risk groups and settings. A simple cascade for tuberculosis transmission has been proposed in which (1) a source case of tuberculosis (2) generates infectious particles (3) that survive in the air and (4) are inhaled by a susceptible individual (5) who may become infected and (6) then has the potential to develop tuberculosis. Interventions that target these events will interrupt tuberculosis transmission and accelerate the decline in tuberculosis incidence and mortality. The purpose of this article is to provide a high-level overview of what is known about tuberculosis transmission, using the tuberculosis transmission cascade as a framework, and to set the scene for the articles in this series, which address specific aspects of tuberculosis transmission.</p></div></div></div><h2> - July 2018 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Incipient and Subclinical Tuberculosis: a Clinical Review of Early Stages and Progression of Infection.</span> (2018).

Historically, scientific research, diagnostic testing, and drug treatment have focused on addressing one of two disease states: latent TB infection or active TB disease. Recent research has clearly demonstrated that human TB infection, from latent infection to active disease, exists within a continuous spectrum of metabolic bacterial activity and antagonistic immunological responses. This revised understanding leads us to propose two additional clinical states: incipient and subclinical TB. The recognition of incipient and subclinical TB, which helps divide latent and active TB along the clinical disease spectrum, provides opportunities for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to prevent progression to active TB disease and transmission of TB bacilli. In this report, we review the current understanding of the pathogenesis, immunology, clinical epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of both incipient and subclinical TB, two emerging clinical states of an ancient bacterium.</p></div></div></div><h2> - January 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Xpert at 8 years: where are we now, and what should we do next?</span> (2019).

To better understand potential immunological differences, we utilized a comprehensive panel to characterize pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving (i.e., mediators involved in the resolution of inflammation) lipid mediators in individuals with TB and TB-DM. A nested cross-sectional study of 40 individuals (20 newly diagnosed DM and 20 without DM) was conducted within a cohort of individuals with active drug-susceptible treatment-na√Øve pulmonary TB. Lipid mediators were quantified in serum samples through lipid mediator profiling. We conducted correlation-based analysis of these mediators. Overall, the arachidonic acid-derived leukotriene and prostaglandin families were the most abundant pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, while lipoxins and maresins families were the most abundant pro-resolving lipid mediators in individuals with TB and TB-DM. Individuals with TB-DM had increased correlations and connectivity with both pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediators compared to those with TB alone. We identified the most abundant lipid mediator metabolomes in circulation among individuals with TB and TB-DM; in addition, our data shows a substantial number of significant correlations between both pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediators in individuals with TB-DM, delineating a molecular balance that potentially defines this comorbidity.</p></div></div></div><h2> - June 2018 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Would pan-tuberculosis treatment regimens be cost-effective?</span> (2018).

If the world is to drastically reduce the incidence of DR-TB, we must stop creating new DR-TB as an essential first step. The DR-TB epidemic that is ongoing should also be directly addressed. First-line drug resistance must be rapidly detected using universal molecular testing for resistance to at least rifampin and, preferably, other key drugs at initial TB diagnosis. DR-TB treatment outcomes must also improve dramatically. Effective use of currently available, new, and repurposed drugs, combined with patient-centered treatment that aids adherence and reduces catastrophic costs, are essential. Innovations within sight, such as short, highly effective, broadly indicated regimens, paired with point-of-care drug susceptibility testing, could accelerate progress in treatment outcomes. Preventing or containing resistance to second-line and novel drugs is also critical and will require high-quality systems for diagnosis, regimen selection, and treatment monitoring. Finally, earlier detection and/or prevention of DR-TB is necessary, with particular attention to airborne infection control, case finding, and preventive therapy for contacts of patients with DR-TB. Implementing these strategies can overcome the barrier that DR-TB represents for global TB elimination efforts, and could ultimately make global elimination of DR-TB (fewer than one annual case per million population worldwide) attainable. There is a strong cost-effectiveness case to support pursuing DR-TB elimination; however, achieving this goal will require substantial global investment plus political and societal commitment at national and local levels.</p></div></div></div><h2> - October 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Ending the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic: Towards an Evidence-Based Approach.</span> (2019).

Although tuberculosis control has been effective in some regions of the world, these gains are threatened by the increasing burden of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis. XDR tuberculosis has evolved in several tuberculosis-endemic countries to drug-incurable or programmatically incurable tuberculosis (totally drug-resistant tuberculosis). This poses several challenges similar to those encountered in the pre-chemotherapy era, including the inability to cure tuberculosis, high mortality, and the need for alternative methods to prevent disease transmission. This phenomenon mirrors the worldwide increase in antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of other MDR pathogens, such as malaria, HIV, and Gram-negative bacteria. MDR and XDR tuberculosis are associated with high morbidity and substantial mortality, are a threat to health-care workers, prohibitively expensive to treat, and are therefore a serious public health problem. In this Commission, we examine several aspects of drug-resistant tuberculosis. The traditional view that acquired resistance to antituberculous drugs is driven by poor compliance and programmatic failure is now being questioned, and several lines of evidence suggest that alternative mechanisms-including pharmacokinetic variability, induction of efflux pumps that transport the drug out of cells, and suboptimal drug penetration into tuberculosis lesions-are likely crucial to the pathogenesis of drug-resistant tuberculosis. These factors have implications for the design of new interventions, drug delivery and dosing mechanisms, and public health policy. We discuss epidemiology and transmission dynamics, including new insights into the fundamental biology of transmission, and we review the utility of newer diagnostic tools, including molecular tests and next-generation whole-genome sequencing, and their potential for clinical effectiveness. Relevant research priorities are highlighted, including optimal medical and surgical management, the role of newer and repurposed drugs (including bedaquiline, delamanid, and linezolid), pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations, preventive strategies (such as prophylaxis in MDR and XDR contacts), palliative and patient-orientated care aspects, and medicolegal and ethical issues.</p></div></div></div><h2> - August 2018 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Chest X-ray for tuberculosis preventive therapy: use caution.</span> (2018).

METHODS: We conducted a case-cohort study (n = 332) within a randomized trial comparing 3 ART regimens in 1571 HIV treatment-naive adults from 9 countries. A subcohort of 30 patients was randomly selected from each country (n = 270). Cases (n = 77; main cohort = 62, random subcohort = 15) included patients diagnosed with TB by 96 weeks post-ART initiation. We determined pretreatment concentrations of vitamin A, carotenoids, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin D, vitamin E, and selenium. We measured associations between pretreatment micronutrient deficiencies and incident TB using Breslow-weighted Cox regression models. RESULTS: Median pretreatment CD4 T-cell count was 170 cells/mm; 47.3% were women; and 53.6% Black. In multivariable models after adjusting for age, sex, country, treatment arm, previous TB, baseline CD4 count, HIV viral load, body mass index, and C-reactive protein, pretreatment deficiency in vitamin A (adjusted hazard ratio, aHR 5.33, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.54 to 18.43) and vitamin D (aHR 3.66, 95% CI: 1.16 to 11.51) were associated with TB post-ART. CONCLUSIONS: In a diverse cohort of HIV-infected adults from predominantly low- and middle-income countries, deficiencies in vitamin A and vitamin D at ART initiation were independently associated with increased risk of incident TB in the ensuing 96 weeks. Vitamin A and D may be important modifiable risk factors for TB in high-risk HIV-infected patients starting ART in resource-limited highly-TB-endemic settings.</p></div></div></div><h2> - October 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Implementation of Xpert(¬Æ) MTB/RIF: real challenges, real promise.</span> (2019).

However, there is no diagnostic gold standard for LTBI. Two tests are available for identification of LTBI: the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the gamma interferon (IFN-Œ≥) release assay (IGRA). Evidence suggests that both TST and IGRA are acceptable but imperfect tests. They represent indirect markers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposure and indicate a cellular immune response to M. tuberculosis. Neither test can accurately differentiate between LTBI and active TB, distinguish reactivation from reinfection, or resolve the various stages within the spectrum of M. tuberculosis infection. Both TST and IGRA have reduced sensitivity in immunocompromised patients and have low predictive value for progression to active TB. To maximize the positive predictive value of existing tests, LTBI screening should be reserved for those who are at sufficiently high risk of progressing to disease. Such high-risk individuals may be identifiable by using multivariable risk prediction models that incorporate test results with risk factors and using serial testing to resolve underlying phenotypes. In the longer term, basic research is necessary to identify highly predictive biomarkers.</p></div></div></div><h2> - November 2018 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>The Importance of Heterogeneity to the Epidemiology of Tuberculosis.</span> (2018).

To advance toward TB elimination, this heterogeneity must be better understood and addressed. Drivers of heterogeneity in TB epidemiology act at the level of the infectious host, organism, susceptible host, environment, and distal determinants. These effects may be amplified by social mixing patterns, while the variable latent period between infection and disease may mask heterogeneity in transmission. Reliance on notified cases may lead to misidentification of the most affected groups, as case detection is often poorest where prevalence is highest. Assuming that average rates apply across diverse groups and ignoring the effects of cohort selection may result in misunderstanding of the epidemic and the anticipated effects of control measures. Given this substantial heterogeneity, interventions targeting high-risk groups based on location, social determinants, or comorbidities could improve efficiency, but raise ethical and equity considerations.</p></div></div></div><h2> - June 2018 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>A systematic review of the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions among patients with tuberculosis.</span> (2018).

The purpose of this review was to synthesize the evidence on interventions and suggest practice, research and policy implications. A systematic review of the literature identified 14 peer-reviewed studies describing 13 smoking cessation interventions between 2007 and 2017. There were five randomized controlled trials, three non-randomized interventions, and five prospective cohort studies. The primary types of interventions were brief advice (n = 9), behavioral counseling (n = 4), medication (n = 3), and community-based care (n = 3). A variety of health care workers (HCWs) implemented interventions, from physicians, nurses, clinic staff, community health workers (CHWs), as did family members. There was significant heterogeneity of design, definition of smoking and smoking abstinence, and implementation, making comparison across studies difficult. Although all smoking interventions increased smoking cessation between 15% and 82%, many studies had a high risk for bias, including six without a control group. The implementing personnel did not make a large difference in cessation results, suggesting that national TB programs may customize according to their needs and limitations. Family members may be important supporters/advocates for cessation. Future research should standardize definitions of smoking and cessation to allow comparisons across studies. Policy makers should encourage collaboration between tobacco and TB initiatives and develop smoking cessation measures to maximize results in low-resource settings.</p></div></div></div><h2> - August 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Home-based tuberculosis contact investigation in Uganda: a household randomised trial.</span> (2019).

Community health workers (CHWs) visited homes of index patients with pulmonary TB to screen household contacts for TB. Entire households were randomly allocated to clinic (standard-of-care) or home (intervention) evaluation. In the intervention arm, CHWs offered HIV testing to adults; collected sputum from symptomatic contacts and persons living with HIV (PLWHs) if ‚â•5‚ÄÖyears; and transported sputum for microbiologic testing. CHWs referred PLWHs, children <5 years, and anyone unable to complete sputum testing to clinic. Sputum testing results and/or follow-up instructions were returned by automated SMS texts. The primary outcome was completion of a full TB evaluation within 14‚ÄÖdays; secondary outcomes were TB and HIV diagnoses and treatments among screened contacts. RESULTS: There were 471 contacts of 190 index patients allocated to the intervention and 448 contacts of 182 index patients allocated to the standard-of-care. CHWs identified 190/471 (40%) intervention and 213/448 (48%) standard-of-care contacts requiring TB evaluation.
