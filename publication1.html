Mobile health (mHealth) interventions may provide innovative opportunities for efficient healthcare delivery and improving retention in care. In this formative research, we interviewed 11 patients and 28 healthcare providers in North West Province, South Africa, to identify perceived benefits, concerns and suggestions for a future mHealth program to deliver HIV Viral Load and CD4 Count test results directly to patients via mobile phone. Thematic analysis found that reduced workload for providers, reduced wait times for patients, potential expanded uses and patient empowerment were the main perceived benefits of an mHealth program. Perceived concerns included privacy, disseminating distressing results through text messages and patients' inability to interpret results. Participants felt that an mHealth program should complement face-to-face interactions and educational information to interpret results is needed. Providers identified logistical considerations and suggested protocols be developed. An mHealth program to deliver HIV test results directly to patients could mitigate multiple barriers to care but needs to be tested for efficacy. Concerns identified by patients and providers must be addressed in designing the program to successfully integrate with health facility workflow and ensure its sustainability.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>High risk for latent tuberculosis infection among medical residents and nursing students in India.</span> (2019).

Prospective cohort study of 200 medical residents and nursing students in India was conducted May 2016-December 2017. Tuberculin skin test (TST) and QuantiFERON TB Gold Test-in-tube (QFT-GIT) were performed at study entry and 12 months. Primary outcome was incident LTBI (>/=10mm TST induration and/or >/=0.35IU/mL QFT-GIT) at 12 months; secondary outcomes included baseline LTBI prevalence and risk factors for incident and prevalent LTBI using Poisson regression. Among 200, [90 nursing students and 110 medical residents], LTBI prevalence was 30% (95% CI, 24-37); LTBI incidence was 26.8 (95% CI, 18.6-37.2) cases per 100 person-years and differed by testing method (28.7 [95% CI, 20.6-38.9] vs 17.4 [95% CI, 11.5-25.4] cases per 100 person-years using TST and QFT-GIT, respectively). Medical residents had two-fold greater risk of incident LTBI than nursing students (Relative Risk, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.05-4.42). During study period 6 (3%) HCWs were diagnosed with active TB disease. Overall, median number of self-reported TB exposures was 5 (Interquartile Range, 1-15). Of 60 participants with prevalent and incident LTBI who were offered free isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), only 2 participants initiated and completed IPT. High risk for LTBI was noted among medical residents compared to nursing students. Self-reported TB exposure is underreported, and uptake of LTBI prevention therapy remains low. New approaches are needed to identify HCWs at highest risk for LTBI.</p></div></div></div><h2> - June 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>A Systematic Review to Evaluate the Association between Clean Cooking Technologies and Time Use in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.</span> (2019).

We performed a systematic review, searching for studies of clean fuel interventions that measured time use. A total of 868 manuscripts were identified that met the search criteria, but only 2 met the inclusion criteria. Both were cross-sectional and were conducted in rural India. The first surveyed the female head of household (141 using biogas and 58 using biomass) and reported 1.2 h saved per day collecting fuel and 0.7 h saved cooking, resulting in a combined 28.9 days saved over an entire year. The second surveyed the head of household (37 using biogas and 68 using biomass, 13% female) and reported 1.5 h saved per day collecting fuel, or 22.8 days saved over a year. Based on these time savings, we estimated that clean fuel use could result in a 3.8% or 4.7% increase in daily income, respectively, not including time or costs for fuel procurement. Clean fuel interventions could save users time and money. Few studies have evaluated this potential benefit, suggesting that prospective studies or randomized controlled trials are needed to adequately measure gains.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Impact and Effectiveness of State-Level Tuberculosis Interventions in California, Florida, New York, and Texas: A Model-Based Analysis.</span> (2019).

However, the impact of such interventions depends on local demography and the heterogeneity of populations at risk. Using state-level individual-based TB transmission models calibrated to California, Florida, New York, and Texas, we modeled 2 TB interventions: 1) increased targeted testing and treatment (TTT) of high-risk populations, including people who are non-US-born, diabetic, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive, homeless, or incarcerated; and 2) enhanced contact investigation (ECI) for contacts of TB patients, including higher completion of preventive therapy. For each intervention, we projected reductions in active TB incidence over 10 years (2016-2026) and numbers needed to screen and treat in order to avert 1 case. We estimated that TTT delivered to half of the non-US-born adult population could lower TB incidence by 19.8%-26.7% over a 10-year period. TTT delivered to smaller populations with higher TB risk (e.g., HIV-positive persons, homeless persons) and ECI were generally more efficient but had less overall impact on incidence. TTT targeted to smaller, highest-risk populations and ECI can be highly efficient; however, major reductions in incidence will only be achieved by also targeting larger, moderate-risk populations. Ultimately, to eliminate TB in the United States, a combination of these approaches will be necessary.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Treatment of latent infection to achieve tuberculosis elimination in low-incidence countries.</span> (2019).

METHODS: We performed spirometry with bronchodilators in new drug-sensitive adult (>/=18 years) pulmonary tuberculosis cases during the 12 months following successful treatment in India. Airflow obstruction was defined as pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC<5th percentile of Global Lung Initiative mixed-ethnicity reference (lower limit of normal [LLN]). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was defined as post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC<LLN among participants with obstruction. Restrictive spirometry pattern was defined as FVC<LLN among participants without obstruction. Multivariable logistic and linear regression was used to identify risk-factors for obstruction, restriction and low lung function despite successful treatment. RESULTS: Of the 172 participants included in the analysis, 82 (48%) were female, 22 (13%) had diabetes and 34 (20%) ever-smoked with a median (IQR) exposure of 3.5 (0.2-9.9) pack-years. Median (IQR) age and body-mass index (BMI) at enrollment was 32 (23-39) years and 18.1 (16.0-20.5) kg/m2 respectively. Airflow obstruction was detected in 42 (24%) participants; of whom 9 (21%) responded to short-acting bronchodilators and 25 (56%) had COPD; and was associated with duration of illness prior to treatment (aOR = 1.32 per 30-days, 95%CI 1.04-1.68, p = 0.02). A restrictive spirometry pattern was detected in 89 (52%) participants and was associated with female sex (aOR = 3.73, 95%CI 1.51-9.17, p = 0.004) and diabetes (aOR = 4.06, 95%CI 1.14-14.42, p = 0.03). Higher HbA1c at treatment initiation was associated with greater odds of a restrictive spirometry pattern (aOR = 1.29 per unit higher HbA1c, 95%CI 1.04 to 1.60, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: We found a high burden of lung function defects and COPD in tuberculosis cases who successfully completed treatment. Screening for chronic lung diseases following treatment and linkage to respiratory health clinics should be included in the routine management plan of all tuberculosis cases in India, regardless of conventional COPD risk-factors such as older age and smoking.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Point of care Xpert MTB/RIF versus smear microscopy for tuberculosis diagnosis in southern African primary care clinics: a multicentre economic evaluation.</span> (2019).

Performing Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) at point of care is feasible, even when performed by minimally trained health-care workers, and when compared with point-of-care smear microscopy, reduces time to diagnosis and pretreatment loss to follow-up. However, whether Xpert is cost-effective at point of care remains unclear. METHODS: We empirically collected cost (US$, 2014) and clinical outcome data from participants presenting to primary health-care facilities in four African countries (South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania) during the TB-NEAT trial. Costs were determined using an bottom-up ingredients approach. Effectiveness measures from the trial included number of cases diagnosed, initiated on treatment, and completing treatment. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness of point-of-care Xpert relative to smear microscopy. The study was performed from the perspective of the health-care provider. FINDINGS: Using data from 1502 patients, we calculated that the mean Xpert unit cost was lower when performed at a centralised laboratory (Lab Xpert) rather than at point of care ($23.00 [95% CI 22.12-23.88] vs $28.03 [26.19-29.87]). Per 1000 patients screened, and relative to smear microscopy, point-of-care Xpert cost an additional $35 529 (27 054-40 025) and was associated with an additional 24.3 treatment initiations ([-20.0 to 68.5]; $1464 per treatment), 63.4 same-day treatment initiations ([27.3-99.4]; $511 per same-day treatment), and 29.4 treatment completions ([-6.9 to 65.6]; $1211 per completion). Xpert costs were most sensitive to test volume, whereas incremental outcomes were most sensitive to the number of patients initiating and completing treatment. The probability of point-of-care Xpert being cost-effective was 90% at a willingness to pay of $3820 per treatment completion. INTERPRETATION: In southern Africa, although point-of-care Xpert unit cost is higher than Lab Xpert, it is likely to offer good value for money relative to smear microscopy. With the current availability of point-of-care nucleic acid amplification platforms (eg, Xpert Edge), these data inform much needed investment and resource allocation strategies in tuberculosis endemic settings.

If the world is to drastically reduce the incidence of DR-TB, we must stop creating new DR-TB as an essential first step. The DR-TB epidemic that is ongoing should also be directly addressed. First-line drug resistance must be rapidly detected using universal molecular testing for resistance to at least rifampin and, preferably, other key drugs at initial TB diagnosis. DR-TB treatment outcomes must also improve dramatically. Effective use of currently available, new, and repurposed drugs, combined with patient-centered treatment that aids adherence and reduces catastrophic costs, are essential. Innovations within sight, such as short, highly effective, broadly indicated regimens, paired with point-of-care drug susceptibility testing, could accelerate progress in treatment outcomes. Preventing or containing resistance to second-line and novel drugs is also critical and will require high-quality systems for diagnosis, regimen selection, and treatment monitoring. Finally, earlier detection and/or prevention of DR-TB is necessary, with particular attention to airborne infection control, case finding, and preventive therapy for contacts of patients with DR-TB. Implementing these strategies can overcome the barrier that DR-TB represents for global TB elimination efforts, and could ultimately make global elimination of DR-TB (fewer than one annual case per million population worldwide) attainable. There is a strong cost-effectiveness case to support pursuing DR-TB elimination; however, achieving this goal will require substantial global investment plus political and societal commitment at national and local levels.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Sub-therapeutic rifampicin concentration is associated with unfavourable tuberculosis treatment outcomes.</span> (2019).

METHODS: We enrolled a prospective cohort of patients with new pulmonary TB receiving thrice-weekly treatment in India. Maximum plasma concentration of each drug was determined at month 1 and 5 using blood samples drawn 2 hours post-dose. Sub-therapeutic cut-offs were: rifampicin <8microg/mL; isoniazid <3microg/mL; pyrazinamide <20microg/mL. Factors associated with lower log-transformed drug concentrations, unfavourable outcomes (composite of treatment failure, all-cause mortality, and recurrence) as well as individual outcomes were examined using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Among 404 participants, rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide concentrations were sub-therapeutic in 85%, 29%, and 12% at month 1 (with similar results for rifampicin and isoniazid at month 5). Rifampicin concentrations were lower with HIV co-infection (1.6 microg/ml vs 4.6 microg/ml; p = 0.015). Unfavourable outcome was observed in 19%; a 1 ug/ml decrease in rifampicin concentration was independently associated with unfavourable outcome (aIRR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.01 - 1.47) and treatment failure (aIRR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.05 - 1.28). A 1 ug/ml decrease in pyrazinamide concentration was associated with recurrence (aIRR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: Rifampicin concentrations were sub-therapeutic in most Indian patients taking a thrice-weekly TB regimen, and low rifampicin and pyrazinamide concentrations were associated with poor outcomes.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a pragmatic, cluster-randomized comparative effectiveness trial of two TB case finding strategies (facility-based screening and contact tracing) in 56 public primary care clinics in two largely rural districts of Limpopo Province, South Africa. In the facility-based screening arm, sputum Xpert MTB/RIF was performed on all patients presenting (for any reason) with TB symptoms to 28 study clinics, and no contact tracing was performed. In the contact-tracing arm, contacts of patients with active TB were identified (via household tracing in 14 clinics and using small monetary incentives in the other 14 clinics), screened for TB symptoms, and offered Xpert MTB/RIF testing. The primary outcome was the number of newly identified patients with TB started on treatment. The analysis used multivariable Poisson regression adjusted for historical clinic-level TB case volumes and district. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02808507). From July 18, 2017, to January 17, 2019, a total of 3,755 individuals started TB treatment across 56 study clinics in the 18-month period. Clinic characteristics and clinic-level averages of patient characteristics were similar across the two arms: 40/56 (71%) clinics were in a rural location, 2,136/3,655 (58%) patients were male, and 2,243 (61%) were HIV positive. The treatment initiation ratio comparing the yield of TB patients started on treatment in the facility-based arm compared to that from the contact-tracing arm was 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-1.30, p = 0. 73). In the contact-tracing arm, 1,677 contacts of 788 new TB index patients were screened, yielding 12 new patients with TB. Prespecified subgroup analyses resulted in similar results, with estimated treatment initiation ratios of 0.96 (95% CI 0.64-1.27; p = 0.78) and 1.23 (95% CI 0.87-1.59; p = 0.29) among historically smaller and historically larger clinics, respectively. This ratio was 1.02 (95% CI 0.66-1.37; p = 0.93) and 1.08 (95% CI 0.74-1.42; p = 0.68) in the Vhembe and Waterberg districts, respectively. The estimated treatment initiation ratio was unchanged in sensitivity analyses excluding 24 records whose TB registration numbers could not be verified (1.03, 95% CI 0.82-1.29; p = 0.78) and excluding transfers-in (1.02, 95% CI 0.80-1.29; p = 0.71). Study limitations include the possibility of imbalance on cluster size owing to changes in catchment population over time and the inability to distinguish the independent effects of the two contact investigation strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Contact tracing based on symptom screening and Xpert MTB/RIF testing did not increase the rate of treatment initiation for TB relative to the less resource-intensive approach of facility-based screening in this rural sub-Saharan setting.

We conducted a discrete choice experiment to quantify service attributes most desired by patients to inform model prioritization. METHODS: Between July and December 2016, a sample of HIV-positive adults on ART at 12 clinics in Zambia were asked to choose between 2 hypothetical facilities that differed across 6 DSD attributes. We used mixed logit models to explore preferences, heterogeneity, and trade-offs. RESULTS: Of 486 respondents, 59% were female and 85% resided in urban locations. Patients strongly preferred infrequent clinic visits [3- vs. 1-month visits: beta (ie, relative utility) = 2.84; P < 0.001]. Milder preferences were observed for waiting time for ART pick-up (1 vs. 6 hours.; beta = -0.67; P < 0.001) or provider (1 vs. 3 hours.; beta = -0.41; P = 0.002); "buddy" ART collection (beta = 0.84; P < 0.001); and ART pick-up location (clinic vs. community: beta = 0.35; P = 0.028). Urban patients demonstrated a preference for collecting ART at a clinic (beta = 1.32, P < 0.001), and although most rural patients preferred community ART pick-up (beta = -0.74, P = 0.049), 40% of rural patients still preferred facility ART collection. CONCLUSIONS: Stable patients on ART primarily want to attend clinic infrequently, supporting a focus in Zambia on optimizing multimonth prescribing over other DSD features-particularly in urban areas. Substantial preference heterogeneity highlights the need for DSD models to be flexible, and accommodate both setting features and patient choice in their design.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Operational characteristics of antiretroviral therapy clinics in Zambia: a time and motion analysis.</span> (2019).

In this study, we aimed to empirically measure current workload of ART clinic staff and patient wait times and service utilization. METHODS: We conducted time and motion (TAM) studies from both the healthcare worker (HCW) and patient perspectives at 10 ART clinics throughout Zambia. Trained personnel recorded times for consecutive discrete activities based on direct observation of clinical and non-clinical activities performed by counselors, clinical officers, nurses, and pharmacy technicians. For patient TAM, we recruited consenting patients and recorded times of arrival and departure and major ART services utilized. Data from 10 clinics were pooled to evaluate median time per patient spent for each activity and patient duration of stay in the clinic. RESULTS: The percentage of observed clinical time for direct patient interaction (median time per patient encounter) was 43.1% for ART counselors (4 min, interquartile range [IQR] 2-7), 46.1% for nurses (3 min, IQR 2-4), 57.2% for pharmacy technicians (2 min, IQR 1-2), and 78.5% for clinical officers (3 min, IQR 2-5). Patient workloads for HCWs were heaviest between 8 AM and 12 PM with few clinical activities observed after 2 PM. The length of patient visits was inversely associated with arrival time - patients arriving prior to 8 AM spent 61% longer at the clinic than those arriving after 8 AM (277 vs. 171 min). Overall, patients spent 219 min on average for non-clinical visits, and 244 min for clinical visits, but this difference was not significant in rural clinics. In comparison, total time patients spent directly with clinic staff were 9 and 12 min on average for non-clinical and clinical visits. CONCLUSION: Current Zambian ART clinic operations include substantial inefficiencies for both patients and HCWs, with workloads heavily concentrated in the first few hours of clinic opening, limiting HCW and patient interaction time. Use of a differentiated care model may help to redistribute workloads during operational hours and prevent backlogs of patients waiting for hours before clinic opening, which may substantially improve ART delivery in the Zambian context.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Aminoglycoside-Induced Hearing Loss Among Patients Being Treated for Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in South Africa: A Prediction Model.</span> (2019). Hong H., Dowdy DW., Dooley KE., Francis HW., Budhathoki C., Han HR., Farley JE, <span class='i'>Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America</span></p><div><a id='ab_btn_36'>View Abstract Text</a><div id='ab_txt_36' class='hidden_abstract'><p>BACKGROUND: Individuals treated for drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) with aminoglycosides (AGs) in resource-limited settings often experience permanent hearing loss, yet there is no practical method to identify those at higher risk. We sought to develop a clinical prediction model of AG-induced hearing loss among patients initiating DR-TB treatment in South Africa. METHODS: Using nested, prospective data from a cohort of 379 South African adults being treated for confirmed DR-TB with AG-based regimens we developed the prediction model using multiple logistic regression. Predictors were collected from clinical, audiological, and laboratory evaluations conducted at the initiation of DR-TB treatment. The outcome of AG-induced hearing loss was identified from audiometric and clinical evaluation by a worsened hearing threshold compared to baseline during the 6-month intensive phase. RESULTS: 63% of participants (n=238) developed any level of hearing loss. The model predicting hearing loss at frequencies from 250 to 8,000Hz included: weekly AG dose, HIV status with CD4 count, age, serum albumin, BMI, and pre-existing hearing loss. This model demonstrated reasonable discrimination (AUC=0.71) and calibration (chi2[8]=6.10, p=.636). Using a cutoff of 80% predicted probability of hearing loss, the positive predictive value of this model was 83% and negative predictive value was 40%. Model discrimination was similar for ultrahigh-frequency hearing loss (frequencies higher than 9,000Hz; AUC=0.81) but weaker for clinically determined hearing loss (AUC=0.60). CONCLUSIONS: This model may identify patients with DR-TB who are at the highest risk of developing AG-induced ototoxicity and may help prioritize patients for AG-sparing regimens in clinical settings where access is limited.</p></div></div></div><h2> - March 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>From Epidemiological Knowledge to Improved Health: A Vision for Translational Epidemiology.</span> (2019).

We performed a scoping review of articles addressing the translation of epidemiological knowledge into improved population health outcomes. We identified five themes in the translational epidemiology literature: foundations of epidemiological thinking, evidence-based public health or medicine, epidemiological education, implementation science, and community-engaged research (including literature on community-based participatory research). We then identified five priority areas for advancing translational epidemiology: (1) scientific engagement with public health; (2) public health communication; (3) epidemiological education; (4) epidemiology and implementation; and (5) community involvement. Using these priority areas as a starting point, we developed a conceptual framework of translational epidemiology that emphasizes interconnectedness and feedback between epidemiology, foundational science, and public health stakeholders. We also identified two to five representative principles in each priority area that could serve as the basis for advancing a vision of translational epidemiology. We believe that an emphasis on translational epidemiology can help the broader field to increase the efficiency of translating epidemiological knowledge into improved health outcomes and to achieve its goal of improving population health.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Gonorrhoea and chlamydia diagnosis as an entry point for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis: a modelling study.</span> (2019).

Diagnosis of NG/CT may provide an efficient entry point for prevention of HIV through the delivery of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP); however, the additional population-level impact of targeting PrEP to MSM diagnosed with NG/CT is unknown. DESIGN: An agent-based simulation model of NG/CT and HIV cocirculation among MSM calibrated against census data, disease surveillance reports and the US National HIV Behavioral Surveillance study. SETTING: Baltimore City, Maryland, USA. INTERVENTIONS: PrEP implementation was modelled under three alternative scenarios: (1) PrEP delivery at NG/CT diagnosis (targeted delivery), (2) PrEP evaluation at NG/CT screening/testing and (3) PrEP evaluation in the general community (untargeted). MAIN OUTCOME: The projected incidence of HIV after 20 years of PrEP delivery under two alternatives: when equal numbers of MSM are (1) screened for PrEP or (2) receive PrEP in each year. RESULTS: Assuming 60% uptake and 60% adherence, targeting PrEP to MSM diagnosed with NG/CT could reduce HIV incidence among MSM in Baltimore City by 12.4% (95% uncertainty range (UR) 10.3% to 14.4%) in 20 years, relative to no PrEP. Expanding the coverage of NG/CT screening (such that individuals experience a 50% annual probability of NG/CT screening and evaluation for PrEP on NG/CT diagnosis) can further increase the impact of targeted PrEP to generate a 22.0% (95% UR 20.1% to 23.9%) reduction in HIV incidence within 20 years. When compared with alternative implementation scenarios, PrEP evaluation at NG/CT diagnosis increased impact of PrEP on HIV incidence by 1.5(95% UR 1.1 to 1.9) times relative to a scenario in which PrEP evaluation happened at the time of NG/CT screening/testing and by 1.6 (95% UR 1.2 to 2.2) times relative to evaluating random MSM from the community. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting MSM infected with NG/CT increases the efficiency and effectiveness of PrEP delivery. If high levels of sexually transmitted infection screening can be achieved at the community level, NG/CT diagnosis may be a highly effective entry point for PrEP initialisation.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Screening for tuberculosis: time to move beyond symptoms.</span> (2019).
