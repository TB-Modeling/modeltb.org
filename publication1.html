Our objective was to determine the longitudinal epidemiology of muscle weakness, physical function, and health-related quality of life and their associations with critical illness and ICU exposures. DESIGN: A multisite prospective study with longitudinal follow-up at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after acute lung injury. SETTING: Thirteen ICUs from four academic teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Two hundred twenty-two survivors of acute lung injury. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At each time point, patients underwent standardized clinical evaluations of extremity, hand grip, and respiratory muscle strength; anthropometrics (height, weight, mid-arm circumference, and triceps skin fold thickness); 6-minute walk distance, and the Medical Outcomes Short-Form 36 health-related quality of life survey. During their hospitalization, survivors also had detailed daily evaluation of critical illness and related treatment variables. Over one third of survivors had objective evidence of muscle weakness at hospital discharge, with most improving within 12 months. This weakness was associated with substantial impairments in physical function and health-related quality of life that persisted at 24 months. The duration of bed rest during critical illness was consistently associated with weakness throughout 24-month follow-up. The cumulative dose of systematic corticosteroids and use of neuromuscular blockers in the ICU were not associated with weakness. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle weakness is common after acute lung injury, usually recovering within 12 months. This weakness is associated with substantial impairments in physical function and health-related quality of life that continue beyond 24 months. These results provide valuable prognostic information regarding physical recovery after acute lung injury. Evidence-based methods to reduce the duration of bed rest during critical illness may be important for improving these long-term impairments.</p></div></div></div><h2> - March 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>From Epidemiologic Knowledge to Improved Health: A Vision for Translational Epidemiology.</span> (2019).

We identified 5 themes in the translational epidemiology literature: foundations of epidemiologic thinking, evidence-based public health or medicine, epidemiologic education, implementation science, and community-engaged research (including literature on community-based participatory research). We then identified 5 priority areas for advancing translational epidemiology: 1) scientific engagement with public health; 2) public health communication; 3) epidemiologic education; 4) epidemiology and implementation; and 5) community involvement. Using these priority areas as a starting point, we developed a conceptual framework of translational epidemiology that emphasizes interconnectedness and feedback among epidemiology, foundational science, and public health stakeholders. We also identified 2-5 representative principles in each priority area that could serve as the basis for advancing a vision of translational epidemiology. We believe an emphasis on translational epidemiology can help the broader field to increase the efficiency of translating epidemiologic knowledge into improved health outcomes and to achieve its goal of improving population health.</p></div></div></div><h2> - December 2018 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Spatially targeted screening to reduce tuberculosis transmission in high-incidence settings.</span> (2018).

Existing tuberculosis control strategies that rely on passive case-finding appear insufficient to achieve targets for reductions in tuberculosis incidence and mortality. Active case-finding strategies aim to detect infectious individuals earlier in their infectious period to reduce onward transmission and improve treatment outcomes. Empirical studies of active case-finding have produced mixed results and determining how to direct active screening to those most at risk remains a topic of intense research. Our systematic review of literature evaluating the effects of geographically targeted tuberculosis screening interventions found three studies in low tuberculosis incidence settings, but none conducted in high tuberculosis incidence countries. We discuss open questions related to the use of spatially targeted approaches for active screening in countries where tuberculosis incidence is highest.</p></div></div></div><h2> - August 2017 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Modelling the social and structural determinants of tuberculosis: opportunities and challenges.</span> (2017).

OBJECTIVE: To review studies employing mathematical modelling to evaluate the epidemiological impact of the structural determinants of TB. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and personal libraries to identify eligible articles. We extracted data on the modelling techniques employed, research question, types of structural determinants modelled and setting. RESULTS: From 232 records identified, we included eight articles published between 2008 and 2015; six employed population-based dynamic TB transmission models and two non-dynamic analytic models. Seven studies focused on proximal TB determinants (four on nutritional status, one on wealth, one on indoor air pollution, and one examined overcrowding, socio-economic and nutritional status), and one focused on macro-economic influences. CONCLUSIONS: Few modelling studies have attempted to evaluate structural determinants of TB, resulting in key knowledge gaps. Despite the challenges of modelling such a complex system, models must broaden their scope to remain useful for policy making. Given the intersectoral nature of the interrelations between structural determinants and TB outcomes, this work will require multidisciplinary collaborations. A useful starting point would be to focus on developing relatively simple models that can strengthen our knowledge regarding the potential effect of the structural determinants on TB outcomes.</p></div></div></div><h2> - July 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Infection free "resisters" among household contacts of adult pulmonary tuberculosis.</span> (2019).

We defined persons with persistently negative LTBI tests at both baseline and followup as pLTBI- and resisters as those who had a high exposure to TB using a published score and remained pLTBI-. We calculated the proportion of resisters overall and resisters with complete absence of response to LTBI tests (0mm TST and/or QFT-GIT <0.01 IU/ml). Using random effects Poisson regression, we assessed factors associated with pLTBI-. Of 799 HHCs in 355 households, 67 (8%) were pLTBI- at 12 months; 52 (6.5%) pLTBI- in 39 households were resisters. Complete absence of response to LTBI tests was found in 27 (53%) resisters. No epidemiological characteristics were associated with the pLTBI- phenotype. LTBI free resisters among HHC exist but are uncommon and are without distinguishing epidemiologic characteristics.

We used in-depth record abstractions and a standard algorithm to classify deaths in persons with tuberculosis as tuberculosis-related or not. We then compared these classifications to causes of death as coded in death certificates. We used multivariable logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios for predictors of tuberculosis-related death among adults compared with those who completed tuberculosis treatment.Results: Of 1,304 adult deaths, 942 (72%) were tuberculosis related, 272 (21%) were not, and 90 (7%) could not be classified. Of 847 tuberculosis-related deaths with death certificates available, 378 (45%) did not list tuberculosis as a cause of death. Adjusting for known risks, we identified new risks for tuberculosis-related death during treatment: absence of pyrazinamide in the initial regimen (adjusted odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-6.0); immunosuppressive medications (adjusted odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.6); incomplete tuberculosis diagnostic evaluation (adjusted odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-3.3), and an alternative nontuberculosis diagnosis before tuberculosis diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.2).Conclusions: Most persons who died with tuberculosis had a tuberculosis-related death. Intensive record review revealed tuberculosis as a cause of death more often than did death certificate diagnoses. New tools, such as a tuberculosis mortality risk score based on our study findings, may identify patients with tuberculosis for in-hospital interventions to prevent death.</p></div></div></div><h2> - May 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Respiratory health status is associated with treatment outcomes in pulmonary tuberculosis.</span> (2019).

Rather, we must design and rigorously evaluate interventions to halt transmission, prioritizing those interventions most likely to achieve population-level impact. Synergy in reducing tuberculosis transmission may be attainable by combining interventions that shrink the reservoir of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (preventive therapy), shorten the time between disease onset and treatment initiation (case finding and diagnosis), and prevent transmission in key settings, such as the built environment (infection control). In evaluating efficacy and estimating population-level impact, cluster-randomized trials and mechanistic models play particularly prominent roles. Historical and contemporary evidence suggests that effective public health interventions can halt tuberculosis transmission, but an evidence-based approach based on knowledge of local epidemiology is necessary for success. We provide a roadmap for designing, evaluating, and modeling interventions to interrupt the process of transmission that fuels a diverse array of tuberculosis epidemics worldwide.</p></div></div></div><h2> - October 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Delays and barriers to early treatment initiation for childhood tuberculosis in India.</span> (2019).

Understanding barriers to early diagnosis and treatment in children may improve care and outcomes.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed among 89 children initiated on anti-TB treatment from a public hospital in Pune during 2016, using a structured questionnaire and hospital records. Health care providers (HCPs) were defined as medical personnel consulted about the child's TB symptoms. Time-to-treatment initiation (TTI) was defined as the number of days between onset of TB symptoms and anti-TB treatment initiation. Based on Revised National TB Control Programme recommendations, delayed TTI was defined as >28 days.RESULTS: Sixty-seven (75%) of 89 enrolled children had significant TTI delays (median 51 days, interquartile range [IQR] 27-86). Sixty-six (74%) children visited 1-8 HCPs in the private sector before approaching the public sector. The median HCP delay was 28 days (IQR 10-75). Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination (aOR 10.96, P = 0.04) and loss of appetite (aOR 4.44, P = 0.04) were associated with delayed TTI.CONCLUSION: The majority of the children had TTI delays due to delays by HCPs in the private sector. Strengthening HCP competency in TB symptom screening and encouraging early referrals are crucial for rapid scaling up of early treatment initiation in childhood TB.</p></div></div></div><h2> - December 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Overcoming limitations of tuberculosis information systems: researcher and clinician perspectives.</span> (2019). van der Heijden YF., Hughes J., Dowdy DW., Streicher E., Chihota V., Jacobson KR., Warren R., Theron G, <span class='i'>Public health action</span>, <span class='i'>9</span>, 120-127</p><div><a id='ab_btn_29'>View Abstract Text</a><div id='ab_txt_29' class='hidden_abstract'><p>SETTING: Tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and treatment requires patients to have multiple encounters with health care systems and the different stakeholders who play a role in curing them to coordinate their efforts. To optimize this process, high-quality, readily available data are required. Data systems to facilitate these linkages are a neglected priority which, if weak, fundamentally undermine TB control interventions. OBJECTIVE: To describe lessons learnt from the use of programmatic data for TB patient care and research. DESIGN: We did a survey of researcher and clinical provider experiences with information systems and developed a tiered approach to addressing frequently reported barriers to high-quality care. RESULTS: Unreliable linkages, incomplete data, lack of a reliable unique patient identifier, and lack of data management expertise were the most important data-related barriers to high-quality patient care and research. We propose the creation of health service delivery environments that facilitate, prioritize, and evaluate high-quality data entry during patient or specimen registration. CONCLUSION: An integrated approach, focused on high-quality data, and centered on unique patient identification will form the foundation for linkages across health systems that reduce patient management errors, bolster surveillance, and enhance the quality of research based on programmatic data.</p></div></div></div><h2> - February 2017 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Describing the global burden of MDR-TB: missing cases or different metrics?</span> (2017).

Sputum smear-negative TB patients account for around one-fifth of tuberculosis transmission. The tuberculosis transmission risk of TB patients with negative results on nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) of respiratory specimens has not been established. We sought to estimate the tuberculosis transmission risk of NAAT-negative TB patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed Maryland TB program data collected from 2004 to 2009, during which time NAAT using the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct Test (MTD) was performed routinely. Patients with sputum Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) isolates having matching genotypes were assigned to clusters. Transmission sequence was approximated by collection order of individuals' first culture-positive specimens. Minimum transmission risks of NAAT (MTD)-negative TB patients and of smear-negative TB patients were estimated based on individuals' positions within clusters. RESULTS: Among 809 patients with culture-confirmed TB, M.tb genotypes were available for 782 (96.7%). For NAA-negative TB patients, the minimum transmission risk estimate was 5.1% (95% CI 0-11.4). For smear-negative TB patients, the minimum transmission risk estimate was 11.2% (95% CI 7.2-15.3). CONCLUSIONS: Minimum transmission risk of NAAT-negative TB patients was lower than that of smear-negative TB patients. However, transmission risk of NAA-negative TB patients appears to not be negligible.</p></div></div></div><h2> - October 2017 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Preventing tuberculosis in people with HIV-no more excuses.</span> (2017).

Household contact tracing offers a potential approach to diagnose more TB cases, and to do so earlier in the disease course. METHODS: Adults newly diagnosed with active TB were recruited from public clinics in Vhembe District, South Africa. Study staff visited index case households and collected sputum specimens for TB testing via smear microscopy and culture. We calculated the yield and the number of households needed to screen (NHNS) to find one additional case. Predictors of new TB among household contacts were evaluated using multilevel logistic regression. RESULTS: We recruited 130 index cases and 282 household contacts. We identified 11 previously undiagnosed cases of bacteriologically-confirmed TB, giving a prevalence of 3.9% (95% CI: 2.0-6.9%) among contacts, a yield of 8.5 per 100 (95% CI: 4.2-15.1) index cases traced, and NHNS of 12 (95% CI: 7-24).

RESULTS: The percentage of observed clinical time for direct patient interaction (median time per patient encounter) was 43.1% for ART counselors (4 min, interquartile range [IQR] 2-7), 46.1% for nurses (3 min, IQR 2-4), 57.2% for pharmacy technicians (2 min, IQR 1-2), and 78.5% for clinical officers (3 min, IQR 2-5). Patient workloads for HCWs were heaviest between 8 AM and 12 PM with few clinical activities observed after 2 PM. The length of patient visits was inversely associated with arrival time - patients arriving prior to 8 AM spent 61% longer at the clinic than those arriving after 8 AM (277 vs. 171 min). Overall, patients spent 219 min on average for non-clinical visits, and 244 min for clinical visits, but this difference was not significant in rural clinics. In comparison, total time patients spent directly with clinic staff were 9 and 12 min on average for non-clinical and clinical visits. CONCLUSION: Current Zambian ART clinic operations include substantial inefficiencies for both patients and HCWs, with workloads heavily concentrated in the first few hours of clinic opening, limiting HCW and patient interaction time. Use of a differentiated care model may help to redistribute workloads during operational hours and prevent backlogs of patients waiting for hours before clinic opening, which may substantially improve ART delivery in the Zambian context.</p></div></div></div><h2> - October 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Incidence of tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults on first- and second-line antiretroviral therapy in India.</span> (2019).

METHODS: We estimated the incidence rate and risk factors of tuberculosis disease in adult PLHIV initiating first- and second-line anti-retroviral therapy (ART) prior to widespread IPT in a public ART center in Pune, India. RESULTS: 4067 participants contributing 5205.7 person-years of follow-up on first-line ART and 871 participants contributing 1031.7 person-years of follow-up on second-line ART were included in the analysis. The incidence rate of tuberculosis was 4.39 cases (95%CI 3.86-5.00) per 100 person-years on first-line ART and 1.64 cases (95%CI 1.01-2.63) per 100 person-years on second-line ART (p < 0.001). After adjusting for competing risks, male sex (aSHR = 1.33, 95%CI 1.02-1.74, p = 0.03), urban residence (aSHR = 1.53, 95%CI 1.13-2.07, p = 0.006) and CD4+ counts < 350 cells/mm(3) (aSHR = 3.06 vs CD4 > 350 cells/mm(3), 95%CI 1.58-5.94, p < 0.001) at ART initiation were associated with higher risk of tuberculosis independent of ART regimen. CONCLUSION: Risk of tuberculosis was lower in PLHIV receiving second-line ART compared to first-line ART. Prioritizing IPT in PLHIV with low CD4+ counts, urban residence and in males may further mitigate the risk of tuberculosis during ART.</p></div></div></div><h2> - July 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>High risk for latent tuberculosis infection among medical residents and nursing students in India.</span> (2019).

Prospective cohort study of 200 medical residents and nursing students in India was conducted May 2016-December 2017. Tuberculin skin test (TST) and QuantiFERON TB Gold Test-in-tube (QFT-GIT) were performed at study entry and 12 months. Primary outcome was incident LTBI (≥10mm TST induration and/or ≥0.35IU/mL QFT-GIT) at 12 months; secondary outcomes included baseline LTBI prevalence and risk factors for incident and prevalent LTBI using Poisson regression. Among 200, [90 nursing students and 110 medical residents], LTBI prevalence was 30% (95% CI, 24-37); LTBI incidence was 26.8 (95% CI, 18.6-37.2) cases per 100 person-years and differed by testing method (28.7 [95% CI, 20.6-38.9] vs 17.4 [95% CI, 11.5-25.4] cases per 100 person-years using TST and QFT-GIT, respectively). Medical residents had two-fold greater risk of incident LTBI than nursing students (Relative Risk, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.05-4.42). During study period 6 (3%) HCWs were diagnosed with active TB disease. Overall, median number of self-reported TB exposures was 5 (Interquartile Range, 1-15). Of 60 participants with prevalent and incident LTBI who were offered free isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), only 2 participants initiated and completed IPT. High risk for LTBI was noted among medical residents compared to nursing students. Self-reported TB exposure is underreported, and uptake of LTBI prevention therapy remains low. New approaches are needed to identify HCWs at highest risk for LTBI.</p></div></div></div><h2> - October 2018 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Projected population-wide impact of antiretroviral therapy-linked isoniazid preventive therapy in a high-burden setting.</span> (2018).

We sought to estimate the broader, population-wide impact of providing a pragmatically implemented 12-month IPT regimen to ART recipients in a high-burden community. DESIGN: Dynamic transmission model of a tuberculosis (TB)-HIV epidemic, calibrated to site-specific, historical epidemiologic and clinical trial data from Khayelitsha, South Africa. METHODS: We projected the 5-year impact of delivering a 12-month IPT regimen community-wide to 85% of new ART initiators and 15%/year of those already on ART, accounting for IPT-attributable reductions in TB infection, progression, and transmission. We also evaluated scenarios of continuously-delivered IPT, ongoing ART scale-up, and lower tuberculosis incidence. RESULTS: Under historical (early 2010) ART coverage, this ART-linked IPT intervention prevented one tuberculosis case per 18 [95% credible interval (CrI) 11-29] people treated. It lowered TB incidence by a projected 23% (95% CrI 14-30%) among people receiving ART, and by 5.2% (95% CrI 2.9-8.7%) in the total population. Continuous IPT reduced the number needed to treat to prevent one case of TB to 10 (95% CrI 7-16), though it required 74% more person-years of therapy (95% CrI 64-94%) to prevent one TB case, relative to 12-month therapy. Under expanding ART coverage, the tuberculosis incidence reduction achieved by 12-month IPT grew to 7.6% (95% CrI 4.3-12.6%). Effect sizes were similar in a simulated setting of lower TB incidence. CONCLUSIONS: IPT in conjunction with ART reduces tuberculosis incidence among those who receive therapy and has additional impact on tuberculosis transmission in the population.</p></div></div></div><h2> - April 2015 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>The epidemiological advantage of preferential targeting of tuberculosis control at the poor.</span> (2015).

Reviewing data on TB disparities in India and the wealth distribution of known TB risk factors, we describe how social mixing patterns could be contributing to TB disparities. Wealth-assortative mixing, whereby individuals are more likely to be in contact with others from similar socio-economic backgrounds, amplifies smaller differences in risk of TB, resulting in large population-level disparities. As disparities and assortativeness increase, TB becomes more difficult to control, an effect that is obscured by looking at population averages of epidemiological parameters, such as case detection rates. We illustrate how TB control efforts may benefit from preferential targeting toward the poor. In India, an equivalent-scale intervention could have a substantially greater impact if targeted at those living below the poverty line than with a population-wide strategy. In addition to potential efficiencies in targeting higher-risk populations, TB control efforts would lead to a greater reduction in secondary TB cases per primary case diagnosed if they were preferentially targeted at the poor. We highlight the need to collect programmatic data on TB disparities and explicitly incorporate equity considerations into TB control plans.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract_nav'><p>Page Navigation:</p><a href='publication0.html'>1</a><a class='current'>2</a><a href='publication2.html'>3</a><a href='publication3.html'>4</a><a href='publication4.html'>5</a><a href='publication5.html'>6</a><a href='publication6.html'>7</a><a href='publication7.html'>8</a><a href='publication8.html'>9</a><a href='publication9.html'>10</a></div>
