          <p>My research focuses on the epidemiology of tuberculosis in South Africa, Brazil, India and the US, with specific focus on the drivers of TB in these settings. I am currently leading a cluster randomized trial in South Africa observing diagnostic and treatment practices for latent TB infection among HIV-infected patients at 14 HIV clinics. Also, in South Africa, I lead a smoking cessation clinical trial among HIV-infected patients and projects investigating indoor air pollution, smoking, and potential mHealth solutions for many patient populations. I also lead a study investigating TB treatment outcomes among TB patients with diabetes in India, and other studies in India looking at impact of indoor air pollution and smoking on TB in this setting.</p>

My research focuses on an inter-disciplinary agenda that aims combine methodologies and topics across disease disciplines, including translational epidemiology, operations research, health economics, health systems and technology assessment. Through my research, I seeks to streamline health economic and epidemiology methods in both mode-based and field-based studies that can supplement evidence-based deisions in global and national-level policies and to innovate new data-gathering moethods/studies. I have more than 10 years of experience conducting  tuberuclosis and HIV/AIDS studies in various low and middle-income countries (India, Lesotho, Malawi, Nepal, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, Zambia, Uganda, Morocco, Timor Leste) as well as in high income countries (Canda, South Korea, United States).
