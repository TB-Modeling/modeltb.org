As AG ototoxicity is dose-dependent, the impact of a surrogate measure of AG exposure on AG-induced hearing loss warrants close attention for settings with limited therapeutic drug monitoring.OBJECTIVE: To explore the prognostic impact of cumulative AG dose on AG ototoxicity in patients following initiation of AG-containing treatment for MDR-TB.DESIGN: This prospective cohort study was nested within an ongoing cluster-randomized trial of nurse case management intervention across 10 MDR-TB hospitals in South Africa.RESULTS: The adjusted hazard of AG regimen modification due to ototoxicity in the high-dose group (≥75 mg/kg/week) was 1.33 times higher than in the low-dose group (<75 mg/kg/week, 95%CI 1.09-1.64). The adjusted hazard of developing audiometric hearing loss was 1.34 times higher than in the low-dose group (95%CI 1.01-1.77). Pre-existing hearing loss (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.71, 95%CI 1.29-2.26) and age (aHR 1.16 per 10 years of age, 95%CI 1.01-1.33) were also associated with an increased risk of hearing loss.CONCLUSION: MDR-TB patients with high AG dose, advanced age and pre-existing hearing loss have a significantly higher risk of AG-induced hearing loss. Those at high risk may be candidates for more frequent monitoring or AG-sparing regimens.</p></div></div></div><h2> - January 2020 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Levofloxacin versus placebo for the treatment of latent tuberculosis among contacts of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (the VQUIN MDR trial): a protocol for a randomised controlled trial.</span> (2020).

However, clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of preventive therapy for presumed multidrug-resistant (MDR) LTBI are lacking. This trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of the antibiotic levofloxacin in preventing the development of active TB among latently infected contacts of index patients with MDR-TB. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group randomised controlled trial will be conducted in 10 provinces of Vietnam. Household contacts living with patients with bacteriologically confirmed rifampicin-resistant or MDR-TB will be eligible for recruitment if they have a positive tuberculin skin test or are known to be immunosuppressed, and do not have active TB. Participants will be randomised to receive either levofloxacin or placebo tablets once per day for 6 months. Screening for incident TB will be performed at 6 months intervals. The primary study outcome is the incidence of bacteriologically confirmed TB within 30 months after randomisation. Analysis will be by intention to treat, using Poisson regression. ETHICS: Ethical approval from the University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee was obtained on 29 April 2015 (2014/929), and from the Vietnam Ministry of Health Institutional Review Board on 30 September 2015 (4040/QD-BYT). DISSEMINATION: Findings of the study will be published in peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

Kendall EA., Malhotra S., Cook-Scalise S., Dowdy DW., Denkinger CM, <span class='i'>Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America</span></p><div><a id='ab_btn_42'>View Abstract Text</a><div id='ab_txt_42' class='hidden_abstract'><p>BACKGROUND: Many candidate regimens for universal treatment of tuberculosis combine novel and existing, widely-used drugs. Appropriate implementation requires evidence-based, context-specific drug-susceptibility testing (DST) strategies. METHODS: We created a Markov state-transition model of 100,000 adults with TB receiving a novel, fluoroquinolone (FQ)-containing regimen. We estimated clinical outcomes and resource utilization with no FQ-DST, universal use of FQ-DST, or FQ-DST only in patients with rifampin-resistant TB ('targeted FQ-DST'). We considered scenarios of stronger (South Africa) and weaker (Southeast Asia) correlation of fluoroquinolone resistance with rifampin resistance. RESULTS: Relative to no FQ-DST, targeted FQ-DST increased cure of FQ-resistant TB by 7.5% (interquartile range 6.7-9.2%) in South Africa and 1.7% (0.7 -2.5%) in Southeast Asia. However, rare FQ resistance among the more-prevalent rifampin-susceptible TB accounted for 50% of FQ-resistant TB in South Africa and 83% in Southeast Asia. As a result, universal FQ-DST further increased cure of FQ-resistant TB by 3.4% (2.3-5.4%) in South Africa and 5.8% (5.1-6.3%) in Southeast Asia. With targeted FQ-DST, one additional patient was cured per 50 (42-70) tests in South Africa and 44 (37-51) in Southeast Asia. When expanding from targeted to universal FQ-DST, one additional cure required 3500 (2300-5500) tests in South Africa and 410 (370-450) in Southeast Asia. The impact of FQ-DST was sensitive to overall treatment effectiveness, regimen robustness to loss of fluoroquinolone activity, and prevalence of both moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide resistance. CONCLUSIONS: FQ-DST improved patient outcomes and was particularly important for high-risk patient groups and less-robust regimens. A universal strategy was favored in generalized epidemics of fluoroquinolone resistance.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Correction: Assessment of lung function in successfully treated tuberculosis reveals high burden of ventilatory defects and COPD.</span> (2019).

To optimize this process, high-quality, readily available data are required. Data systems to facilitate these linkages are a neglected priority which, if weak, fundamentally undermine TB control interventions. OBJECTIVE: To describe lessons learnt from the use of programmatic data for TB patient care and research. DESIGN: We did a survey of researcher and clinical provider experiences with information systems and developed a tiered approach to addressing frequently reported barriers to high-quality care. RESULTS: Unreliable linkages, incomplete data, lack of a reliable unique patient identifier, and lack of data management expertise were the most important data-related barriers to high-quality patient care and research. We propose the creation of health service delivery environments that facilitate, prioritize, and evaluate high-quality data entry during patient or specimen registration. CONCLUSION: An integrated approach, focused on high-quality data, and centered on unique patient identification will form the foundation for linkages across health systems that reduce patient management errors, bolster surveillance, and enhance the quality of research based on programmatic data.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Projecting the impact of variable MDR-TB transmission efficiency on long-term epidemic trends in South Africa and Vietnam.</span> (2019). Salvatore PP., Kendall EA., Seabrook D., Brown J., Durham GH., Dowdy DW, <span class='i'>Scientific reports</span>, <span class='i'>9</span>, 18099</p><div><a id='ab_btn_45'>View Abstract Text</a><div id='ab_txt_45' class='hidden_abstract'><p>Whether multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is less transmissible than drug-susceptible (DS-)TB on a population level is uncertain. Even in the absence of a genetic fitness cost, the transmission potential of individuals with MDR-TB may vary by infectiousness, frequency of contact, or duration of disease. We used a compartmental model to project the progression of MDR-TB epidemics in South Africa and Vietnam under alternative assumptions about the relative transmission efficiency of MDR-TB. Specifically, we considered three scenarios: consistently lower transmission efficiency for MDR-TB than for DS-TB; equal transmission efficiency; and an initial deficit in the transmission efficiency of MDR-TB that closes over time. We calibrated these scenarios with data from drug resistance surveys and projected epidemic trends to 2040. The incidence of MDR-TB was projected to expand in most scenarios, but the degree of expansion depended greatly on the future transmission efficiency of MDR-TB. For example, by 2040, we projected absolute MDR-TB incidence to account for 5% (IQR: 4-9%) of incident TB in South Africa and 14% (IQR: 9-26%) in Vietnam assuming consistently lower MDR-TB transmission efficiency, versus 15% (IQR: 8-27%)and 41% (IQR: 23-62%), respectively, assuming shrinking transmission efficiency deficits. Given future uncertainty, specific responses to halt MDR-TB transmission should be prioritized.</p></div></div></div><h2> - November 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Lipid mediators of inflammation and Resolution in individuals with tuberculosis and tuberculosis-Diabetes.</span> (2019).

To better understand potential immunological differences, we utilized a comprehensive panel to characterize pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving (i.e., mediators involved in the resolution of inflammation) lipid mediators in individuals with TB and TB-DM. A nested cross-sectional study of 40 individuals (20 newly diagnosed DM and 20 without DM) was conducted within a cohort of individuals with active drug-susceptible treatment-naïve pulmonary TB. Lipid mediators were quantified in serum samples through lipid mediator profiling. We conducted correlation-based analysis of these mediators. Overall, the arachidonic acid-derived leukotriene and prostaglandin families were the most abundant pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, while lipoxins and maresins families were the most abundant pro-resolving lipid mediators in individuals with TB and TB-DM. Individuals with TB-DM had increased correlations and connectivity with both pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediators compared to those with TB alone. We identified the most abundant lipid mediator metabolomes in circulation among individuals with TB and TB-DM; in addition, our data shows a substantial number of significant correlations between both pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediators in individuals with TB-DM, delineating a molecular balance that potentially defines this comorbidity.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Cost-effectiveness of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube versus tuberculin skin test for diagnosis and treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in primary health care workers in Brazil.</span> (2019).

DESIGN: Analytical model for decision making, characterized by cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: Primary Care Level, considering primary health care workers in Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: An analytical model for decision making, characterized by a tree of probabilities of events, was developed considering a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 primary health care workers, using the software TreeAge Pro™ 2013 to simulate the clinical and economic impacts of new diagnostic technology (QuantiFERON®-TB Gold in-Tube) versus the traditional tuberculin skin test. METHODS: This model simulated five diagnostic strategies for LTBI in primary health care workers (HCW) in Brazil: tuberculin skin testing using ≥5 mm cut-off, tuberculin skin testing ≥10 mm cut-off, QuantiFERON®-TB Gold in-Tube, tuberculin skin testing using ≥5 mm cut-off confirmed by QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube if TST positive, tuberculin skin testing using ≥10 mm cut-off confirmed by QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube if TST positive. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures are the number of individuals correctly classified by the test and the number of Tuberculosis cases avoided. RESULTS: The most cost-effective strategy was the tuberculin skin test considering ≥10mm cut-off. The isolated use of the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube revealed the strategy of lower efficiency with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$ 146.05 for each HCW correctly classified by the test. CONCLUSIONS: The tuberculin skin test using ≥10 mm cut-off was the most cost-effective strategy in the diagnosis of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in primary health care works in Brazil.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Quality of care for patients evaluated for tuberculosis in the context of Xpert MTB/RIF scale-up.</span> (2019).

We evaluated the quality of care for patients undergoing TB evaluation at microscopy centers (spokes) linked to Xpert testing sites (hubs) in Uganda. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the extent to which patients were receiving care in accordance with international and national guidelines. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of all adults with presumptive pulmonary TB at 24 health centers linked to Xpert testing sites. Health center staff photographed TB registers, and uploaded photos to a secure server bi-weekly. We assessed the proportion of patients (1) initiating testing; (2) completing testing; and (3) treated for confirmed TB within 14 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Between January to December 2017, 6744 patients underwent evaluation for pulmonary TB. Only 1316 patients had sputum referred for Xpert testing, including 1075/3229 (33.3%) people living with HIV and 241/3515 (6.9%) without HIV. Of 119 patients confirmed to have TB by Xpert testing, 44 (36%) did not initiate treatment. There were significant losses along the entire diagnostic cascade of care, with only 5330/6744 (79.0%) patients having samples referred for sputum-based testing, 2978/5330 (55.9%) patients completing recommended testing if referred, and 313/418 (74.9%) patients initiating treatment within 14 days if confirmed to have TB. CONCLUSIONS: Although coverage of Xpert testing services across Uganda is high, the quality of care delivered to patients undergoing TB evaluation remains poor. Further research is needed to identify health system interventions to facilitate uptake of Xpert testing and high-quality care.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Correction: Smoking, alcohol use disorder and tuberculosis treatment outcomes: A dual co-morbidity burden that cannot be ignored.</span> (2019).

METHODS: We estimated the incidence rate and risk factors of tuberculosis disease in adult PLHIV initiating first- and second-line anti-retroviral therapy (ART) prior to widespread IPT in a public ART center in Pune, India. RESULTS: 4067 participants contributing 5205.7 person-years of follow-up on first-line ART and 871 participants contributing 1031.7 person-years of follow-up on second-line ART were included in the analysis. The incidence rate of tuberculosis was 4.39 cases (95%CI 3.86-5.00) per 100 person-years on first-line ART and 1.64 cases (95%CI 1.01-2.63) per 100 person-years on second-line ART (p < 0.001).

We determined the potential effectiveness of CD4-based guidelines for TB testing and preventive therapy. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized THRio trial for isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT). METHODS: We analyzed data from 4114 newly registered patients with HIV in 29 clinics followed until TB diagnosis, death, or administrative censoring. We compared incidence rates of TB and TB/death between CD4, TST, IPT, and antiretroviral therapy categories. RESULTS: Initial CD4 cell count was 350 cells/μl or less in 2138 (52%) and more than 350 cells/μl in 1976 (48%) patients.

Understanding barriers to early diagnosis and treatment in children may improve care and outcomes.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed among 89 children initiated on anti-TB treatment from a public hospital in Pune during 2016, using a structured questionnaire and hospital records. Health care providers (HCPs) were defined as medical personnel consulted about the child's TB symptoms. Time-to-treatment initiation (TTI) was defined as the number of days between onset of TB symptoms and anti-TB treatment initiation. Based on Revised National TB Control Programme recommendations, delayed TTI was defined as >28 days.RESULTS: Sixty-seven (75%) of 89 enrolled children had significant TTI delays (median 51 days, interquartile range [IQR] 27-86). Sixty-six (74%) children visited 1-8 HCPs in the private sector before approaching the public sector. The median HCP delay was 28 days (IQR 10-75). Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination (aOR 10.96, P = 0.04) and loss of appetite (aOR 4.44, P = 0.04) were associated with delayed TTI.CONCLUSION: The majority of the children had TTI delays due to delays by HCPs in the private sector.

We conducted a comparative analysis of tuberculosis (TB) epidemiology and potential intervention effects in California, using three previously developed epidemiologic models of TB.Objectives: To compare the influence of various modeling methods and assumptions on epidemiologic projections of domestic latent TB infection (LTBI) control interventions in California.Methods: We compared model results between 2005 and 2050 under a base-case scenario representing current TB services and alternative scenarios including: 1) sustained interruption of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transmission, 2) sustained resolution of LTBI and TB prior to entry of new residents, and 3) one-time targeted testing and treatment of LTBI among 25% of non-U.S.-born individuals residing in California.Measurements and Main Results: Model estimates of TB cases and deaths in California were in close agreement over the historical period but diverged for LTBI prevalence and new Mtb infections-outcomes for which definitive data are unavailable. Between 2018 and 2050, models projected average annual declines of 0.58-1.42% in TB cases, without additional interventions. A one-time LTBI testing and treatment intervention among non-U.S.-born residents was projected to produce sustained reductions in TB incidence. Models found prevalent Mtb infection and migration to be more significant drivers of future TB incidence than local transmission.Conclusions: All models projected a stagnation in the decline of TB incidence, highlighting the need for additional interventions including greater access to LTBI diagnosis and treatment for non-U.S.-born individuals. Differences in model results reflect gaps in historical data and uncertainty in the trends of key parameters, demonstrating the need for high-quality, up-to-date data on TB determinants and outcomes.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Clinical Consequences of Using an Indeterminate Range for Early Infant Diagnosis of HIV: A Decision Model.</span> (2019). Salvatore P., Johnson K., Vojnov L., Doherty M., Dowdy D, <span class='i'>Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999)</span>, <span class='i'>82</span>, 287-296</p><div><a id='ab_btn_55'>View Abstract Text</a><div id='ab_txt_55' class='hidden_abstract'><p>BACKGROUND: To minimize false-positive diagnoses of HIV in exposed infants, the World Health Organization recommends confirmatory testing for all infants initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). In settings where confirmatory testing is not feasible or intermittently performed, clinical decisions may be aided by semi-quantitative cycle thresholds (Cts) that identify positive results most likely to be false-positive. METHODS: We developed a decision analysis model of HIV-exposed infants in sub-Saharan Africa to estimate the clinical consequences of deferring ART for infants with weakly positive ("indeterminate") results. We assessed the degree to which "indeterminate" results may reduce the number of infants starting ART unnecessarily while missing a small number of HIV-infected infants. Our primary outcome was the ratio of averted unnecessary ART regimens to additional HIV-related deaths (due to false-negative diagnosis) at different Ct cutoffs. RESULTS: The clinical consequences of adopting an indeterminate range varied with the prevalence of HIV and Ct cutoff. Considering a Ct cutoff ≥33, adopting an indeterminate range could prevent a median of 1.4 infants from receiving ART unnecessarily (95% UR: 1.0-2.0) for each additional HIV-related death. This ratio could be improved by prioritizing infants with indeterminate results for confirmatory testing [median 8.8 (95% UR: 6.0-13.3)] and by adopting a higher cutoff [median 82.3 (95% UR: 49.0-155.8) with Ct ≥36]. CONCLUSIONS: When implemented in settings where confirmatory testing is not universal, the benefits of classifying weakly positive results as "indeterminate" may outweigh the risks. Accordingly, the World Health Organization has recommended Ct values ≥33 be considered indeterminate for infant HIV diagnosis.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Ending the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic: Towards an Evidence-Based Approach.</span> (2019).

This article provides guidance for TB triage test evaluations. A TB triage test is designed for use in people with TB symptoms and/or significant risk factors for TB. Triage tests are simple and low-cost tests aiming to improve ease of access and implementation (compared with confirmatory tests) and decrease the proportion of patients requiring more expensive confirmatory testing. Evaluation of triage tests should occur in settings of intended use, such as community and primary healthcare centers. Important considerations for triage test evaluation include study design, population, sample type, test throughput, use of thresholds, reference standard (ideally culture), and specimen flow. The impact of a triage test will depend heavily on issues beyond accuracy, primarily centered on implementation.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Adherence to tuberculosis preventive therapy measured by urine metabolite testing among people with HIV.</span> (2019).

We sought to quantify adherence to isoniazid preventive therapy using a urine metabolite assay. DESIGN: Two cross-sectional surveys. SETTING: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2008-2009; and Northwest Province, South Africa, 2018-2019. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and three Brazilian and 93 South African patients attending HIV clinics with active prescriptions for isoniazid preventive therapy MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:: Self-reported isoniazid adherence, paired with semiquantitative measurement of urine isoniazid metabolites. RESULTS: By self-report, 90% of patients [95% confidence interval (CI) 86-93%] reported having taken a dose of isoniazid on the day of enrollment or the preceding day, and 91% (95% CI 87-94%) reported missing an average of one dose or fewer per week. By urine testing, only 65% (95% CI 59-70%) of all patients, and 69% (95% CI 63-74%) of those who reported having taken isoniazid on the current or preceding day, had detectable urine metabolites (expected in 95% of patients at 24 h). Longer time since starting preventive therapy was independently associated with a negative urine test for isoniazid metabolites (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.11 per month of isoniazid, 95% CI 1.05-1.18). CONCLUSION: Adherence to isoniazid preventive therapy among patients with HIV in Brazil and South Africa is inadequate, is overestimated by self-report, and declines with time on treatment. Shorter regimens for TB preventive therapy may improve adherence and completion, but adherence support for all patients may be necessary.</p></div></div></div><h2> - September 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Promoting Tuberculosis Preventive Therapy for People Living with HIV in South Africa: Interventions Hindered by Complicated Clinical Guidelines and Imbalanced Patient-Provider Dynamics.</span> (2019).

The objective of this study was to examine both nurse perceptions of clinical mentorship and patient perceptions of in-queue health education for promoting IPT uptake in Potchefstroom, South Africa. We measured adoption, fidelity, acceptability, and sustainability of the interventions using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Adoption, fidelity, and acceptability of the interventions were moderately high. However, nurses believed they could not sustain their increased prescriptions of IPT, and though many patients intended to ask nurses about IPT, few did. Most patients attributed their behavior to an imbalance of patient-provider power. National IPT guidelines should be unambiguous and easily implemented after minimal training on patient eligibility and appropriate medication durations, nurse-patient dynamics should empower the patient, and district-level support and monitoring should be implemented.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract_nav'><p>Page Navigation:</p><a href='publication0.html'>1</a><a href='publication1.html'>2</a><a class='current'>3</a><a href='publication3.html'>4</a><a href='publication4.html'>5</a><a href='publication5.html'>6</a><a href='publication6.html'>7</a><a href='publication7.html'>8</a><a href='publication8.html'>9</a><a href='publication9.html'>10</a></div>
