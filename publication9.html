Understanding the balance between these two mechanisms is essential when allocating resources for MDR tuberculosis. We aimed to create a dynamic transmission model of an MDR tuberculosis epidemic to estimate the contributions of treatment-related acquisition and person-to-person transmission of resistance to incident MDR tuberculosis cases. METHODS: In this modelling analysis, we constructed a dynamic transmission model of an MDR tuberculosis epidemic, allowing for both treatment-related acquisition and person-to-person transmission of resistance. We used national tuberculosis notification data to inform Bayesian estimates of the proportion of each country's 2013 MDR tuberculosis incidence that resulted from MDR transmission rather than treatment-related MDR acquisition. FINDINGS: Global estimates of 3.5% MDR tuberculosis prevalence among new tuberculosis notifications and 20.5% among re-treatment notifications translate into an estimate that resistance transmission rather than acquisition accounts for a median 95.9% (95% uncertainty range [UR] 68.0-99.6) of all incident MDR tuberculosis, and 61.3% (16.5-95.2) of incident MDR tuberculosis in previously treated individuals. The estimated proportion of MDR tuberculosis resulting from transmission varied substantially with different countries' notification data-ranging from 48% (95% UR 30-75) in Bangladesh to 99% (91-100) in Uzbekistan. Estimates were most sensitive to estimates of the transmissibility of MDR strains, the probability of acquiring MDR during tuberculosis treatment, and the responsiveness of MDR tuberculosis to first-line treatment. INTERPRETATION: Notifications of MDR prevalence from most high-burden settings are consistent with most incident MDR tuberculosis resulting from transmission rather than new treatment-related acquisition of resistance. Merely improving the treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis is unlikely to greatly reduce future MDR tuberculosis incidence. Improved diagnosis and treatment of MDR tuberculosis-including new tests and drug regimens-should be highly prioritised.

Mathematical modelling can provide helpful insight by describing the types of interventions likely to maximize impact on the population level and highlighting those gaps in our current knowledge that are most important for making such assessments. This review discusses the major contributions of TB transmission models in general, namely, the ability to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of TB. We focus particularly on those elements that are important to appropriately understand the role of TB diagnosis and treatment (i.e., what elements of better diagnosis or treatment are likely to have greatest population-level impact) and yet remain poorly understood at present. It is essential for modellers, decision-makers, and epidemiologists alike to recognize these outstanding gaps in knowledge and understand their potential influence on model projections that may guide critical policy choices (e.g., investment and scale-up decisions).</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Bridging the gap between evidence and policy for infectious diseases: How models can aid public health decision-making.</span> (2015).

Although systematic reviews are frequently commissioned to inform specific components of policy (such as efficacy), the same process is rarely applied to the full decision-making process. Mathematical models provide a mechanism through which empirical evidence can be methodically and transparently integrated to address such questions. However, such models are often considered difficult to interpret. In addition, models provide estimates that need to be iteratively re-evaluated as new data or considerations arise. Using the case study of a novel diagnostic for tuberculosis, a framework for improved collaboration between public health decision-makers and mathematical modellers that could lead to more transparent and evidence-driven policy decisions for infectious diseases in the future is proposed. The framework proposes that policymakers should establish long-term collaborations with modellers to address key questions, and that modellers should strive to provide clear explanations of the uncertainty of model structure and outputs. Doing so will improve the applicability of models and clarify their limitations when used to inform real-world public health policy decisions.</p></div></div></div><h2> - October 2015 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Stopping the body count: a comprehensive approach to move towards zero tuberculosis deaths.</span> (2015).

Successful disease elimination campaigns are characterised by locally tailored responses that are informed by appropriate data. To develop such a response to tuberculosis, we suggest a three-step process that includes improved collection and use of existing programmatic data, collection of additional data (eg, geographic information, drug resistance, and risk factors) to inform tailored responses, and targeted collection of novel data (eg, sequencing data, targeted surveys, and contact investigations) to improve understanding of tuberculosis transmission dynamics. Development of a locally targeted response for tuberculosis will require substantial investment to reconfigure existing systems, coupled with additional empirical data to evaluate the effectiveness of specific approaches. Without adoption of an elimination strategy that uses local data to target hotspots of transmission, ambitious targets to end tuberculosis will almost certainly remain unmet.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Toward the optical "magic carpet": reducing the divergence of a light sheet below the diffraction limit.</span> (2015).

DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study among TB patients aged 18 years conducted in 2011. The primary outcome was the status of DOT received, while the secondary was the outcome of anti-tuberculosis treatment. RESULTS: In 2011, 35 775 (38.3%) subjects received DOT. The odds of receiving DOT were higher in patients with the following characteristics: brown/mestizo patients (OR 1.18, 95%CI 1.14-1.22) and those of other ethnic groups (OR 2.01, 95%CI 1.79-2.27) compared to Whites, alcohol users (OR 1.37, 95%CI 1.28-1.47) and those with mental disorders (OR 1.88, 95%CI 1.54-2.29). The odds of receiving DOT were lower in human immunodeficiency virus positive patients (OR 0.64, 95%CI 0.60-0.68). Patients who did not receive DOT were more likely to default from anti-tuberculosis treatment (OR 0.62, 95%CI 0.57-0.66), die due to TB (OR 0.68, 95%CI 0.61-0.77) and to have unknown treatment outcomes (OR 0.71, 95%CI 0.66-0.76). The adjusted preventable fraction of DOT in the reduction of unfavorable outcomes was 25%. CONCLUSION: Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics are determinants of anti-tuberculosis treatment outcomes in patients undergoing DOT; DOT use led to a 25% reduction in unfavorable outcomes.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Economic and epidemiological impact of early antiretroviral therapy initiation in India.</span> (2015).

We sought to quantify how the cost-effectiveness and epidemiological impact of early ART strategies in India are affected by attrition throughout the HIV care continuum. METHODS: We constructed a dynamic compartmental model replicating HIV transmission, disease progression and health system engagement among Indian adults. Our model of the Indian HIV epidemic compared implementation of early ART initiation (i.e. initiation above CD4 >/=350 cells/mm(3)) with delayed initiation at CD4 </=350 cells/mm(3); primary outcomes were incident cases, deaths, quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) and costs over 20 years. We assessed how costs and effects of early ART initiation were impacted by suboptimal engagement at each stage in the HIV care continuum. RESULTS: Assuming "idealistic" engagement in HIV care, early ART initiation is highly cost-effective ($442/QALY-gained) compared to delayed initiation at CD4 </=350 cells/mm(3) and could reduce new HIV infections to <15,000 per year within 20 years. However, when accounting for realistic gaps in care, early ART initiation loses nearly half of potential epidemiological benefits and is less cost-effective ($530/QALY-gained). We project 1,285,000 new HIV infections and 973,000 AIDS-related deaths with deferred ART initiation with current levels of care-engagement in India. Early ART initiation in this continuum resulted in 1,050,000 new HIV infections and 883,000 AIDS-related deaths, or 18% and 9% reductions (respectively), compared to current guidelines. Strengthening HIV screening increases benefits of earlier treatment modestly (1,001,000 new infections; 22% reduction), while improving retention in care has a larger modulatory impact (676,000 new infections; 47% reduction). CONCLUSIONS: Early ART initiation is highly cost-effective in India but only has modest epidemiological benefits at current levels of care-engagement. Improved retention in care is needed to realize the full potential of earlier treatment.</p></div></div></div><h2> - September 2015 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>The Distribution of Fitness Costs of Resistance-Conferring Mutations Is a Key Determinant for the Future Burden of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis: A Model-Based Analysis.</span> (2015).

It is well established that the expected future trend in resistance depends on the reproductive fitness of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, the variability in fitness between strains with different resistance-conferring mutations has been largely ignored when making these predictions. METHODS: We developed a novel approach for incorporating the variable fitness costs of drug resistance-conferring mutations and for tracking this distribution of fitness costs over time within a transmission model. We used this approach to describe the effects of realistic fitness cost distributions on the future prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis. RESULTS: The shape of the distribution of fitness costs was a strong predictor of the long-term prevalence of resistance. While, as expected, lower average fitness costs of drug resistance-conferring mutations were associated with more severe epidemics of drug-resistant tuberculosis, fitness distributions with greater variance also led to higher levels of drug resistance. For example, compared to simulations in which the fitness cost of resistance was fixed, introducing a realistic amount of variance resulted in a 40% increase in prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis after 20 years. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in the fitness costs associated with drug resistance-conferring mutations are a key determinant of the future burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Future studies that can better establish the range of fitness costs associated with drug resistance-conferring mutations will improve projections and thus facilitate better public health planning efforts.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>The Epidemiologic and Economic Impact of Improving HIV Testing, Linkage, and Retention in Care in the United States.</span> (2015).

We sought to determine the economic and epidemiologic impact of incomplete engagement in HIV care in the United States. METHODS: We constructed a dynamic transmission model of HIV among US adults (aged 15-65 years) and conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of improvements along the HIV care continuum : We evaluated enhanced HIV testing (annual for high-risk groups), increased 3-month linkage to care (to 90%), and improved retention (50% relative reduction in yearly disengagement and 50% increase in reengagement). Our primary outcomes were HIV incidence, mortality, costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: Despite early ART initiation, a projected 1.39 million (95% uncertainty range [UR], 0.91-2.2 million) new HIV infections will occur at a (discounted) cost of $256 billion ($199-298 billion) over 2 decades at existing levels of HIV care engagement. Enhanced testing with increased linkage has modest epidemiologic benefits and could reduce incident HIV infections by 21% (95% UR, 13%-26%) at a cost of $65 700 per QALY gained ($44 500-111 000). By contrast, comprehensive improvements that couples enhanced testing and linkage with improved retention would reduce HIV incidence by 54% (95% UR, 37%-68%) and mortality rate by 64% (46%-78%), at a cost-effectiveness ratio of $45 300 per QALY gained ($27 800-72 300). CONCLUSIONS: Failure to improve engagement in HIV care in the United States leads to excess infections, treatment costs, and deaths. Interventions that improve not just HIV screening but also retention in care are needed to optimize epidemiologic impact and cost-effectiveness.</p></div></div></div><h2> - August 2015 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Tobacco smoking and tuberculosis treatment outcomes: a prospective cohort study in Georgia.</span> (2015).

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of adults with laboratory-confirmed tuberculosis from May 2011 to November 2013. History of tobacco smoking was collected using a standardized questionnaire adapted from the global adult tobacco survey. We considered tuberculosis therapy to have a poor outcome if participants defaulted, failed treatment or died. We used multivariable regressions to estimate the risk of a poor treatment outcome. FINDINGS: Of the 591 tuberculosis patients enrolled, 188 (31.8%) were past smokers and 271 (45.9%) were current smokers. Ninety (33.2%) of the current smokers and 24 (18.2%) of the participants who had never smoked had previously been treated for tuberculosis (P < 0.01). Treatment outcome data were available for 524 of the participants, of whom 128 (24.4%) - including 80 (32.9%) of the 243 current smokers and 21 (17.2%) of the 122 individuals who had never smoked - had a poor treatment outcome. Compared with those who had never smoked, current smokers had an increased risk of poor treatment outcome (adjusted relative risk, aRR: 1.70; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.00-2.90). Those who had ceased smoking more than two months before enrolment did not have such an increased risk (aRR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.51-1.99). CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of smoking among patients with tuberculosis in Georgia and smoking increases the risk of a poor treatment outcome.</p></div></div></div><h2> - July 2015 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Pathways and costs of care for patients with tuberculosis symptoms in rural Uganda.</span> (2015).

OBJECTIVE: To determine pathways to care and associated costs for patients with chronic cough referred for tuberculosis (TB) evaluation in Uganda. DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study, surveying 64 patients presenting with chronic cough and undergoing first-time sputum evaluation at government clinics. We also surveyed a random sample of 114 individuals with chronic cough in surrounding communities. We collected information on previous health visits for the cough as well as costs associated with the current visit. RESULTS: Eighty per cent of clinic patients had previously sought care for their cough, with a median of three previous visits (range 0-32, interquartile range [IQR] 2-5). Most (n = 203, 88%) visits were to a health facility that did not provide TB microscopy services, and the majority occurred in the private sector. The cost of seeking care for the current visit alone represented 28.8% (IQR 9.1-109.5) of the patients' median monthly household income. CONCLUSION: Most patients seek health care for chronic cough, but do so first in the private sector. Engagement of the private sector and streamlining TB diagnostic evaluation are critical for improving case detection and meeting global TB elimination targets.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Optimal Timing of Antiretroviral Therapy Initiation for HIV-Infected Adults With Newly Diagnosed Pulmonary Tuberculosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</span> (2015).

PURPOSE: To assess evidence from randomized, controlled trials of the timing of ART initiation in HIV-infected adults with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, conference abstracts, and ClinicalTrials.gov (from January 1980 to May 2015). STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, controlled trials evaluating early versus delayed ART initiation (1 to 4 weeks vs. 8 to 12 weeks after initiation of TB treatment) or deferred ART initiation (after the end of TB treatment). DATA EXTRACTION: Three reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The main outcome measures were all-cause mortality and the TB-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS). DATA SYNTHESIS: The 8 included trials (n = 4568) were conducted in Africa, Asia, and the United States and were generally at low risk of bias for the assessed domains. Overall, early ART reduced mortality compared with delayed ART (relative risk [RR], 0.81 [95% CI, 0.66 to 0.99]; I2 = 0%). In a prespecified subgroup analysis, early ART reduced mortality compared with delayed ART among patients with baseline CD4+ T-cell counts less than 0.050 x 109 cells/L (RR, 0.71 [CI, 0.54 to 0.93]; I2 = 0%). However, a mortality benefit from early ART was not found among those with CD4+ T-cell counts greater than 0.050 x 109 cells/L (RR, 1.05 [CI, 0.68 to 1.61]; I2 = 56%). Early ART was associated with a higher incidence of TB-IRIS than delayed ART (RR, 2.31 [CI, 1.87 to 2.86]; I2 = 19%). LIMITATION: Few trials provided sufficient data for subgroup analysis. CONCLUSION: Early ART in HIV-infected adults with newly diagnosed TB improves survival in those with CD4+ T-cell counts less than 0.050 x 109 cells/L, although this is associated with a 2-fold higher frequency of TB-IRIS. In patients with CD4+ T-cell counts greater than 0.050 x 109 cells/L, evidence is insufficient to support or refute a survival benefit conferred by early versus delayed ART initiation.

Using operational data from rural Malawi, we explored the potential cost-effectiveness of on-demand screening for TB in low-income countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. DESIGN AND METHODS: Costs were empirically collected in 4 clinics and in 1 hospital using a microcosting approach, through direct interview and observation from the national TB program perspective. Using decision analysis, newly diagnosed persons with HIV were modeled as being screened by 1 of the 3 strategies: Xpert, LED, or standard of care (ie, at the discretion of the treating physician). RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness of TB screening among persons newly diagnosed with HIV was largely determined by 2 factors: prevalence of active TB among patients newly diagnosed with HIV and volume of testing. In facilities screening at least 50 people with a 6.5% prevalence of TB, or at least 500 people with a 2.5% TB prevalence, Xpert is likely to be cost-effective. At lower prevalence-including that observed in Malawi-LED microscopy may be the preferred strategy, whereas in settings of lower TB prevalence or small numbers of eligible patients, no screening may be reasonable (such that resources can be deployed elsewhere). CONCLUSIONS: TB screening at the point of HIV diagnosis may be cost-effective in low-income countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, but only if a relatively large population with high prevalence of TB can be identified for screening.</p></div></div></div><h2> - May 2015 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Reducing relapse in tuberculosis treatment: is it time to reassess WHO treatment guidelines?</span> (2015).

We analyzed the costs and consequences of using IGRAs for the diagnosis of active TB in India from the perspective of the Indian TB control sector. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We constructed a decision analytic model to estimate the incremental cost and effectiveness of IGRAs for the diagnosis of active TB in India. We compared a reference scenario of clinical examination and non-microbiological tests against scenarios in which clinical diagnosis was augmented by the addition of either sputum smear microscopy, IGRA, or Xpert MTB/RIF. We examined costs (in 2013 US dollars) and consequences from the perspective of the Indian healthcare sector. Relative to sputum smear microscopy, use of IGRA for active TB resulted in 23,700 (95% uncertainty range, UR: 3,800 - 38,300) additional true-positive diagnoses, but at the expense of 315,700 (95% UR: 118,300 - 388,400) additional false-positive diagnoses and an incremental cost of US$49.3 million (95% UR: $34.9 - $58.0 million) (2.9 billion Indian Rupees). Relative to Xpert MTB/RIF (including the cost of treatment for drug resistant TB), use of IGRA led to 400 additional TB cases treated (95% UR: [-8,000] - 16,200), 370,600 (95% UR: 252,200 - 441,700) more false-positive diagnoses, 70,400 (95% UR: [-7,900] - 247,200) fewer disability-adjusted life years averted, and US$14.6 million (95%UR: [-$7.2] - $28.7 million) (854 million Indian Rupees) in additional costs. CONCLUSION: Using IGRAs for diagnosis of active TB in a setting like India results in tremendous overtreatment of people without TB, and substantial incremental cost with little gain in health. These results support the policies by WHO and Standards for TB Care in India, which discourage the use of IGRAs for the diagnosis of active TB in India and similar settings.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>The epidemiological advantage of preferential targeting of tuberculosis control at the poor.</span> (2015).

Reviewing data on TB disparities in India and the wealth distribution of known TB risk factors, we describe how social mixing patterns could be contributing to TB disparities. Wealth-assortative mixing, whereby individuals are more likely to be in contact with others from similar socio-economic backgrounds, amplifies smaller differences in risk of TB, resulting in large population-level disparities. As disparities and assortativeness increase, TB becomes more difficult to control, an effect that is obscured by looking at population averages of epidemiological parameters, such as case detection rates. We illustrate how TB control efforts may benefit from preferential targeting toward the poor. In India, an equivalent-scale intervention could have a substantially greater impact if targeted at those living below the poverty line than with a population-wide strategy. In addition to potential efficiencies in targeting higher-risk populations, TB control efforts would lead to a greater reduction in secondary TB cases per primary case diagnosed if they were preferentially targeted at the poor. We highlight the need to collect programmatic data on TB disparities and explicitly incorporate equity considerations into TB control plans.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Performance of a Novel Algorithm Using Automated Digital Microscopy for Diagnosing Tuberculosis.</span> (2015).

Use of TBDx as part of a diagnostic algorithm could improve the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), but its performance characteristics have not yet been formally tested. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of the TBDx automated microscopy system in algorithms for diagnosis of TB. METHODS: Prospective samples from patients with presumed TB were processed in parallel with conventional smear microscopy, TBDx microscopy, and liquid culture. All TBDx-positive specimens were also tested with the Xpert MTB/RIF (GXP) assay. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of two algorithms-(1) TBDx-GXP (TBDx with positive specimens tested by Xpert MTB/RIF) and (2) TBDx alone-against the gold standard liquid media culture. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 1,210 samples, 1,009 were eligible for evaluation, of which 109 were culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The TBDx system identified 70 specimens (68 culture positive) as having 10 or more putative AFB (high positive) and 207 (19 culture positive) as having 1-9 putative AFB (low positive). An algorithm in which "low-positive" results on TBDx were confirmed by GXP had 78% sensitivity (85 of 109) and 99.8% specificity (889 of 900), requiring 21% (207 of 1,009) specimens to be processed by GXP. As a stand-alone test, a "high-positive" result on TBDx had 62% sensitivity and 99.7% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: TBDx used in diagnostic algorithms with GXP provided reasonable sensitivity and high specificity for active TB while dramatically reducing the number GXP tests performed. As a stand-alone microscopy system, its performance was equivalent to that of a highly experienced TB microscopist.</p></div></div></div><h2> - March 2015 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Drivers and trajectories of resistance to new first-line drug regimens for tuberculosis.</span> (2015).

Because population-level data on resistance cannot be collected in advance, epidemiological models are important tools for understanding the drivers and dynamics of resistance before novel drug regimens are launched. METHODS: We developed a transmission model of TB after launch of a new drug regimen, defining drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) as resistance to the new regimen. The model is characterized by (1) the probability of acquiring resistance during treatment, (2) the transmission fitness of DR-TB relative to drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB), and (3) the probability of treatment success for DR-TB versus DS-TB. We evaluate the effect of each factor on future DR-TB prevalence, defined as the proportion of incident TB that is drug-resistant. RESULTS: Probability of acquired resistance was the strongest predictor of the DR-TB proportion in the first 5 years after the launch of a new drug regimen. Over a longer term, however, the DR-TB proportion was driven by the resistant population's transmission fitness and treatment success rates. Regardless of uncertainty in acquisition probability and transmission fitness, high levels (>10%) of drug resistance were unlikely to emerge within 50 years if, among all cases of TB that were detected, 85% of those with DR-TB could be appropriately diagnosed as such and then successfully treated. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term surveillance cannot predict long-term drug resistance trends after launch of novel first-line TB regimens. Ensuring high treatment success of drug-resistant TB through early diagnosis and appropriate second-line therapy can mitigate many epidemiological uncertainties and may substantially slow the emergence of drug-resistant TB.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract_nav'><p>Page Navigation:</p><a href='publication0.html'>1</a><a href='publication1.html'>2</a><a href='publication2.html'>3</a><a href='publication3.html'>4</a><a href='publication4.html'>5</a><a href='publication5.html'>6</a><a href='publication6.html'>7</a><a href='publication7.html'>8</a><a href='publication8.html'>9</a><a class='current'>10</a></div>
