We aimed to project the impact of achieving NHAS goals on HIV incidence, prevalence, mortality, and costs among adults in the USA over 10 years. METHODS: We constructed a dynamic transmission model of HIV progression and care engagement based on literature sources and the most recent published US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. We specifically considered achievement of the 2020 targets set forth in NHAS progress indicator 1 (90% awareness of serostatus), indicator 4 (85% linkage within 1 month), and indicator 5 (90% of diagnosed individuals in care). FINDINGS: At current rates of engagement in the HIV care continuum, we project 524,000 (95% uncertainty range 442,000-712,000) new HIV infections and 375,000 deaths (364,000-578,000) between 2016 and 2025. Achievement of NHAS progress indicators 1 and 4 has modest epidemiological effect (new infections reduced by 2·0% and 3·9%, respectively). By contrast, increasing the proportion of diagnosed individuals in care (NHAS indicator 5) averts 52% (95% UR 47-56) of new infections. Achievement of all NHAS targets resulted in a 58% reduction (95% UR 52-61) in new infections and 128 000 lives saved (106,000-223,000) at an incremental health system cost of US$105 billion. INTERPRETATION: Achievement of NHAS progress indicators for screening, linkage, and particularly improving retention in care, can substantially reduce the burden of HIV in the USA, but continued and increased financial investment will be required.

Use of TBDx as part of a diagnostic algorithm could improve the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), but its performance characteristics have not yet been formally tested. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of the TBDx automated microscopy system in algorithms for diagnosis of TB. METHODS: Prospective samples from patients with presumed TB were processed in parallel with conventional smear microscopy, TBDx microscopy, and liquid culture. All TBDx-positive specimens were also tested with the Xpert MTB/RIF (GXP) assay. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of two algorithms-(1) TBDx-GXP (TBDx with positive specimens tested by Xpert MTB/RIF) and (2) TBDx alone-against the gold standard liquid media culture. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 1,210 samples, 1,009 were eligible for evaluation, of which 109 were culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The TBDx system identified 70 specimens (68 culture positive) as having 10 or more putative AFB (high positive) and 207 (19 culture positive) as having 1-9 putative AFB (low positive). An algorithm in which "low-positive" results on TBDx were confirmed by GXP had 78% sensitivity (85 of 109) and 99.8% specificity (889 of 900), requiring 21% (207 of 1,009) specimens to be processed by GXP. As a stand-alone test, a "high-positive" result on TBDx had 62% sensitivity and 99.7% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: TBDx used in diagnostic algorithms with GXP provided reasonable sensitivity and high specificity for active TB while dramatically reducing the number GXP tests performed. As a stand-alone microscopy system, its performance was equivalent to that of a highly experienced TB microscopist.</p></div></div></div><h2> - November 2020 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Incorporating Patient Reporting Patterns to Evaluate Spatially Targeted TB Interventions.</span> (2020).

However, standard TB notification data may not sufficiently capture this heterogeneity. Better understanding of patient reporting patterns (discrepancies between residence and place of presentation) may improve our ability to use notifications to appropriately target interventions. METHODS: Using demographic data and TB reports from Dhaka North (DNCC) and South (DSCC) City Corporations, we identified wards of high TB incidence and developed a TB transmission model. We calibrated the model to patient-level data from selected wards under four different reporting pattern assumptions and estimated the relative impact of targeted versus untargeted active case finding (ACF). RESULTS: The impact of geographically targeted interventions varied substantially depending on reporting pattern assumptions. The relative reduction in TB incidence, comparing targeted to untargeted ACF in DNCC, was 1.20, assuming weak correlation between reporting and residence, versus 2.45, assuming perfect correlation. Similar patterns were observed in DSCC (1.03 versus 2.08). CONCLUSION: Movement of individuals seeking TB diagnoses may substantially affect ward-level TB transmission. Better understanding of patient reporting patterns can improve estimates of the impact of targeted interventions in reducing TB incidence. Incorporating high-quality patient-level data is critical to optimizing TB interventions.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Tobacco Smoking and Tuberculosis among Men Living with HIV in Johannesburg, South Africa: A Case-Control Study.</span> (2016).

Given that a high proportion of patients with TB are co-infected with HIV in South Africa, the risks arising from the intersection of smoking, TB, and HIV/AIDS have key relevance for tobacco control policies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) with current tobacco smoking among men with HIV in South Africa. DESIGN: Case-control study of antiretroviral therapy naïve men with confirmed HIV-infection in Johannesburg. Cases had laboratory-confirmed PTB and controls had no evidence of active TB. Participants were interviewed to collect detailed smoking histories. RESULTS: We enrolled 146 men diagnosed with PTB and 133 controls. Overall, 33% of participants were currently smoking, defined as smoking a cigarette within 2 months (34% cases vs. 32% controls, p = 0.27). Median CD4 count was lower (60 vs. 81 cells/mm3, P = 0.03) and median viral load was higher (173 vs. 67 copies/ul per thousand, P<0.001) among cases versus controls. In adjusted analyses, current smoking tripled the odds of PTB (aOR 3.2; 95%CI: 1.3-7.9, P = 0.01) and former smoking nearly doubled the odds of PTB (aOR 1.8; 95%CI 0.8-4.4, P = 0.18) compared to never smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Males with HIV that smoke are at greater odds for developing PTB than non-smokers. Extensive smoking cessation programs are needed to reduce odds of TB and promote health among adults living with HIV.</p></div></div></div><h2> - June 2020 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Is distance associated with tuberculosis treatment outcomes?

We aimed to evaluate whether distance from residence to health facility chosen for treatment is associated with TB treatment outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients initiating TB treatment at six health facilities in Kampala from 2014 to 2016. We investigated associations between distance to treating facility and unfavorable TB treatment outcomes (death, loss to follow up, or treatment failure) using multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: Unfavorable treatment outcomes occurred in 20% (339/1691) of TB patients. The adjusted relative risk (aRR) for unfavorable treatment outcomes (compared to treatment success) was 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70, 1.07) for patients living ≥2 km from the facility compared to those living closer. When we separately compared each type of unfavorable treatment outcome to favorable outcomes, those living ≥2 km from the facility had increased risk of death (aRR 1.42 [95%CI 0.99, 2.03]) but decreased risk for loss to follow-up (aRR 0.57 [95%CI 0.41, 0.78]) than those living within 2 km. CONCLUSIONS: Distance from home residence to TB treatment facility is associated with increased risk of death but decreased risk of loss to follow up. Those who seek care further from home may have advanced disease, but once enrolled may be more likely to remain in treatment.</p></div></div></div><h2> - November 2020 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Health-related quality of life of inpatients and outpatients with TB in rural Malawi.</span> (2020).

This study aims to assess the extent of such reductions and the trajectory of HRQoL over the course of treatment in rural Malawi.METHODS: We collected patient demographic and socioeconomic status, TB-related characteristics, and HRQoL data (i.e., EQ-5D and a visual analogue scale VAS) from adults (age ≥18 years) being treated for TB in 12 primary health centers and one hospital in rural Thyolo District, Malawi, from 2014 to 2016. Associations between HRQoL and patient characteristics were estimated using multivariable linear regression.RESULTS: Inpatients (n = 197) consistently showed lower median HRQoL scores and suffered more severe health impairments during hospitalization than outpatients (n = 156) (EQ5D and VAS: 0.79, 55 vs. 0.84, 70). Longer treatment duration was associated with higher HRQoL among outpatients (EQ5D: 0.034 increase per 2 months, 95%CI 0.012-0.057). We found no substantial associations between patients´ demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and HRQoL in this setting.CONCLUSION: HRQoL scores among patients receiving treatment for TB in rural Malawi differ by clinical setting and duration of treatment, with greater impairment among inpatients and those early in their treatment course.</p></div></div></div><h2> - June 2016 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Use of Rapid, Point-of-Care Assays by Private Practitioners in Chennai, India: Priorities for Tuberculosis Diagnostic Testing.</span> (2016).

As new molecular tests are developed for point-of-care (POC) diagnosis of TB, it is imperative to understand these individuals' practices and preferences for POC testing. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate rapid testing practices and identify priorities for novel POC TB tests among private practitioners in Chennai. DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 228 practitioners practicing in the private sector from January 2014 to February 2015 who saw at least one TB patient in the previous year. Practitioners were randomly selected from both the general community and a list of practitioners who referred patients to a public-private mix program for TB treatment. We used standardized questionnaires to collect data on current practices related to point-of-care diagnosis and interest in hypothetical POC tests. We used multivariable Poisson regression with robust estimates of standard error to calculate measures of association. RESULTS: Among 228 private practitioners, about half (48%) utilized any rapid testing in their current practice, most commonly for glucose (43%), pregnancy (21%), and malaria (5%). Providers using POC tests were more likely to work in hospitals (56% vs. 43%, P = 0.05) and less likely to be chest specialists (21% vs. 54%, P<0.001). Only half (51%) of providers would use a hypothetical POC test for TB that was accurate, equipment-free, and took 20 minutes to complete. Chest specialists were half as likely to express interest in performing the hypothetical POC TB test in-house as other practitioners (aPR 0.5, 95%CI: 0.2-0.9). Key challenges to performing POC testing for TB in this study included time constraints, easy access to local private labs and lack of an attached lab facility. CONCLUSION: As novel POC tests for TB are developed and scaled up, attention must be paid to integrating these diagnostics into healthcare providers' routine practice and addressing barriers for POC testing.</p></div></div></div><h2> - December 2016 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Expected effects of adopting a 9 month regimen for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a population modelling analysis.</span> (2016).

We aimed to investigate the population-level implications of scaling up this new regimen. METHODS: In this population modelling analysis, we developed a dynamic transmission model to simulate the introduction of this short-course regimen as an instantaneous switch in 2016. We projected the corresponding percentage reduction in the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis by 2024 compared with continued use of longer therapy. In the primary analysis in a representative southeast Asian setting, we assumed that the short-course regimen would double treatment access (through savings in resources or capacity) and achieve long-term efficacy at levels seen in preliminary cohort studies. We then did extensive sensitivity analyses to explore a range of alternative scenarios. FINDINGS: Under the optimistic assumptions in the primary analysis, the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in 2024 would be 3·3 (95% uncertainty range 2·2-5·6) per 100 000 population with the short-course regimen and 4·3 (2·9-7·6) per 100 000 population with continued use of longer therapy-ie, the short-course regimen could reduce incidence by 23% (10-38). Incidence would be reduced by 14% (4-28) if the new regimen affected only treatment effectiveness and by 11% (3-24) if it affected only treatment availability. Under more pessimistic assumptions, the short-course regimen would have minimal effect and even potential for harm-eg, when 30% of patients are ineligible for the new regimen because of second-line drug resistance, we projected a change in incidence of -2% (-20 to +28). The new regimen's effect was greater in settings with more ongoing transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, but results were otherwise similar across settings with different levels of tuberculosis incidence and prevalence of multidrug resistance. INTERPRETATION: The short-course regimen has potential to substantially lessen the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis epidemic, but this effect depends on its long-term efficacy, its ability to expand treatment access, and the role of second-line drug resistance.

New regimens that can shorten treatment hold promise for improving treatment completion and success, but their impact on population-level transmission remains unclear. Earlier models projected that a four-month regimen could reduce TB incidence by 10% but assumed that an entire course of therapy must be completed to derive any benefit. We constructed a dynamic transmission model of TB disease calibrated to global estimates of incidence, prevalence, mortality, and treatment success. To account for the efficacy of partial treatment, we used data from clinical trials of early short-course regimens to estimate relapse rates among TB patients who completed one-third, one-half, two-thirds, and all of their first-line treatment regimens. We projected population-level incidence and mortality over 10 years, comparing standard six-month therapy to hypothetical shorter-course regimens with equivalent treatment success but fewer defaults. The impact of hypothetical four-month regimens on TB incidence after 10 years was smaller than estimated in previous modeling analyses (1.9% [95% uncertainty range 0.6-3.1%] vs. 10%). Impact on TB mortality was larger (3.5% at 10 years) but still modest. Transmission impact was most sensitive to the proportion of patients completing therapy: four-month therapy led to greater incidence reductions in settings where 25% of patients leave care ("default") over six months. Our findings remained robust under one-way variation of model parameters. These findings suggest that novel regimens that shorten treatment duration may have only a modest effect on TB transmission except in settings of very low treatment completion.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Subtherapeutic Rifampicin Concentration Is Associated With Unfavorable Tuberculosis Treatment Outcomes.</span> (2019).

METHODS: We enrolled a prospective cohort of patients with new pulmonary TB receiving thrice-weekly treatment in India. The maximum plasma concentration of each drug was determined at months 1 and 5 using blood samples drawn 2 hours postdose. Subtherapeutic cutoffs were: rifampicin <8 µg/mL, isoniazid <3 µg/mL, and pyrazinamide <20 µg/mL. Factors associated with lower log-transformed drug concentrations, unfavorable outcomes (composite of treatment failure, all-cause mortality, and recurrence), and individual outcomes were examined using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Among 404 participants, rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide concentrations were subtherapeutic in 85%, 29%, and 13%, respectively, at month 1 (with similar results for rifampicin and isoniazid at month 5). Rifampicin concentrations were lower with human immunodeficiency virus coinfection (median, 1.6 vs 4.6 µg/mL; P = .015). Unfavorable outcome was observed in 19%; a 1-μg/mL decrease in rifampicin concentration was independently associated with unfavorable outcome (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR], 1.21 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.01-1.47]) and treatment failure (aIRR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.05-1.28]). A 1-μg/mL decrease in pyrazinamide concentration was associated with recurrence (aIRR, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.01-1.11]). CONCLUSIONS: Rifampicin concentrations were subtherapeutic in most Indian patients taking a thrice-weekly TB regimen, and low rifampicin and pyrazinamide concentrations were associated with poor outcomes. Higher or more frequent dosing is needed to improve TB treatment outcomes in India.</p></div></div></div><h2> - November 2020 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tuberculosis epidemic a modelling analysis.</span> (2020).

We sought to estimate the potential long-term epidemiological impact of such disruptions on TB burden in high-burden countries, and how this negative impact could be mitigated. METHODS: We adapted mathematical models of TB transmission in three high-burden countries (India, Kenya and Ukraine) to incorporate lockdown-associated disruptions in the TB care cascade. The anticipated level of disruption reflected consensus from a rapid expert consultation. We modelled the impact of these disruptions on TB incidence and mortality over the next five years, and also considered potential interventions to curtail this impact. FINDINGS: Even temporary disruptions can cause long-term increases in TB incidence and mortality. If lockdown-related disruptions cause a temporary 50% reduction in TB transmission, we estimated that a 3-month suspension of TB services, followed by 10 months to restore to normal, would cause, over the next 5 years, an additional 1⋅19 million TB cases (Crl 1⋅06-1⋅33) and 361,000 TB deaths (CrI 333-394 thousand) in India, 24,700 (16,100-44,700) TB cases and 12,500 deaths (8.8-17.8 thousand) in Kenya, and 4,350 (826-6,540) cases and 1,340 deaths (815-1,980) in Ukraine. The principal driver of these adverse impacts is the accumulation of undetected TB during a lockdown. We demonstrate how long term increases in TB burden could be averted in the short term through supplementary "catch-up" TB case detection and treatment, once restrictions are eased. INTERPRETATION: Lockdown-related disruptions can cause long-lasting increases in TB burden, but these negative effects can be mitigated with rapid restoration of TB services, and targeted interventions that are implemented as soon as restrictions are lifted.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between body mass index (BMI) and sputum culture conversion during treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 212 MDR-TB patients. MDR-TB was confirmed using culture in liquid medium and line-probe assay. Patients were treated with a standardised regimen unless they were resistant to any of the drugs tested. Study outcomes were time to culture conversion (primary) and probability of conversion within 4 months (secondary). Data were analysed using Kaplan-Meier curves, discrete time-survival analysis and Poisson regression. RESULTS: Compared to patients with normal weight (BMI ≥18.5 kg/m(2)), severely underweight patients (BMI <16 kg/m(2)) had longer time to initial conversion (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.55, 95%CI 0.37-0.84) and a lower probability of sputum culture conversion within 4 months (adjusted relative risk 0.67, 95%CI 0.54-0.83). Other predictors for longer sputum culture conversion were female sex (aHR 0.55, 95%CI 0.39-0.78), resistance to injectables (aHR 0.59, 95%CI 0.42-0.83) and high baseline smear grade (aHR 0.33, 95%CI 0.18-0.60). CONCLUSION: Severe underweight was associated with longer time to initial sputum culture conversion among MDR-TB patients.</p></div></div></div><h2> - September 2020 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Alcohol abstinence stigma and alcohol use among HIV patients in Thai Nguyen, Vietnam.</span> (2020).

In Vietnam, alcohol use is highly normative making it socially challenging for PWH to reduce or abstain. We used mixed methods to develop a quantitative scale to assess alcohol abstinence stigma and examined the association between alcohol abstinence stigma with alcohol use among PWH in Vietnam. METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews with 30 PWH with hazardous alcohol use from an antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic in the Thai Nguyen to inform item development. Alcohol use was assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. We tested items in a survey of 1,559 ART clinic patients to assess internal consistency and structural validity. We used log binomial modeling to estimate associations between any reported alcohol abstinence stigma and alcohol use. RESULTS: Using the results from the qualitative interview data, we developed the alcohol abstinence stigma scale with seven final items with scores ranging from 0 (no stigma) to 28 (high stigma). The scale had good internal consistency (α = 0.75). Exploratory factor analysis suggested the presence of three factors: internalized, experienced, and anticipated stigma that explained 56.9% of the total variance. The mean score was 2.74, (SD = 4.28) and 46% reported any alcohol abstinence stigma. We observed a dose-response relationship between alcohol abstinence stigma and alcohol use. PWH who reported any alcohol abstinence stigma had greater hazardous alcohol use (aPR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.56), harmful alcohol use (aPR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.37, 3.72), and dependence symptoms (aPR = 3.81, 95% CI: 2.19, 6.64). CONCLUSION: Alcohol abstinence stigma is associated with increased alcohol levels of alcohol use among PWH in Vietnam, signaling challenges for alcohol reduction. Consideration of alcohol abstinence stigma will be essential for the design of effective alcohol reduction interventions and policy efforts to prevent adverse health consequences of alcohol use among PWH.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>The impact of novel tests for tuberculosis depends on the diagnostic cascade.</span> (2014).

METHODS: We developed a conceptual framework for assessing implementation costs. We illustrate the use of this framework with case studies involving interventions for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS in resource-limited settings. RESULTS: Costs of implementing public health interventions may be conceptualized as occurring across three phases: design, initiation, and maintenance. In the design phase, activities include developing intervention components and establishing necessary infrastructure (e.g., technology, standard operating procedures). Initiation phase activities include training, initiation of supply chains and quality assurance procedures, and installation of equipment. Implementation costs in the maintenance phase include ongoing technical support, monitoring and evaluation, and troubleshooting unexpected obstacles. Within each phase, implementation costs can be incurred at the site of delivery ("site-specific" costs) or more centrally ("above-service" or "central" costs). For interventions evaluated in the context of research studies, implementation costs should be classified as programmatic, research-related, or shared research/program costs. Purely research-related costs are often excluded from analysis of programmatic implementation. CONCLUSIONS: In evaluating public health interventions in resource-limited settings, accounting for implementation costs enables more realistic estimates of budget impact and cost-effectiveness and provides important insights into program feasibility, scale-up, and sustainability. Assessment of implementation costs should be planned prospectively and performed in a standardized manner to ensure generalizability.</p></div></div></div><h2> - March 2020 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Challenges with scale-up of GeneXpert MTB/RIF® in Uganda: a health systems perspective.</span> (2020).

However, the effect of scale up on reducing TB has been limited. We sought to characterize variation in implementation of referral-based Xpert TB testing across Uganda, and to identify health system factors that may enhance or prevent high-quality implementation of Xpert testing services. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study triangulating quantitative and qualitative data sources at 23 community health centers linked to one of 15 Xpert testing sites between November 2016 and May 2017 to assess health systems infrastructure for hub-and-spoke Xpert testing. Data sources included a standardized site assessment survey, routine TB notification data, and field notes from site visits. RESULTS: Challenges with Xpert implementation occurred at every step of the diagnostic evaluation process, leading to low overall uptake of testing. Of 2192 patients eligible for TB testing, only 574 (26%) who initiated testing were referred for Xpert testing. Of those, 54 (9.4%) were Xpert confirmed positive just under half initiated treatment within 14 days (n = 25, 46%). Gaps in required infrastructure at 23 community health centers to support the hub-and-spoke system included lack of refrigeration (n = 14, 61%) for sputum testing and lack of telephone/mobile communication (n = 21, 91%). Motorcycle riders responsible for transporting sputum to Xpert sites operated variable with trips once, twice, or three times a week at 10 (43%), nine (39%) and four (17%) health centers, respectively. Staff recorded Xpert results in the TB laboratory register at only one health center and called patients with positive results at only two health centers. Of the 15 Xpert testing sites, five (33%) had at least one non-functioning module. The median number of tests per day was 3.57 (IQR 2.06-4.54), and 10 (67%) sites had error/invalid rates > 5%. CONCLUSIONS: Although Xpert devices are now widely distributed throughout Uganda, health system factors across the continuum from test referral to results reporting and treatment initiation preclude effective implementation of Xpert testing for patients presenting to peripheral health centers. Support for scale up of innovative technologies should include support for communication, coordination and health systems integration.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract_nav'><p>Page Navigation:</p><a href='publication0.html'>1</a><a href='publication1.html'>2</a><a href='publication2.html'>3</a><a href='publication3.html'>4</a><a href='publication4.html'>5</a><a href='publication5.html'>6</a><a href='publication6.html'>7</a><a href='publication7.html'>8</a><a href='publication8.html'>9</a><a class='current'>10</a></div>
