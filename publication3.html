OBJECTIVES: Knowledge of the relative contribution and extent of the individual sources of variability (immunological, preanalytical, or analytical) could help optimize testing protocols. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of studies published by October 2013 on all potential sources of variability of commercial IFN-γ release assays (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube and T-SPOT.TB). The included studies assessed test variability under identical conditions and under different conditions (the latter both overall and stratified by individual sources of variability). Linear mixed effects models were used to estimate within-subject SD. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified a total of 26 articles, including 7 studies analyzing variability under the same conditions, 10 studies analyzing variability with repeat testing over time under different conditions, and 19 studies reporting individual sources of variability. Most data were on QuantiFERON (only three studies on T-SPOT.TB). A considerable number of conversions and reversions were seen around the manufacturer-recommended cut-point. The estimated range of variability of IFN-γ response in QuantiFERON under identical conditions was ±0.47 IU/ml (coefficient of variation, 13%) and ±0.26 IU/ml (30%) for individuals with an initial IFN-γ response in the borderline range (0.25-0.80 IU/ml). The estimated range of variability in noncontrolled settings was substantially larger (±1.4 IU/ml; 60%). Blood volume inoculated into QuantiFERON tubes and preanalytic delay were identified as key sources of variability. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review shows substantial variability with repeat IFN-γ release assays testing even under identical conditions, suggesting that reversions and conversions around the existing cut-point should be interpreted with caution.</p></div></div></div><h2> - May 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Assessment of lung function in successfully treated tuberculosis reveals high burden of ventilatory defects and COPD.</span> (2019).

METHODS: We performed spirometry with bronchodilators in new drug-sensitive adult (≥18 years) pulmonary tuberculosis cases during the 12 months following successful treatment in India. Airflow obstruction was defined as pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC<5th percentile of Global Lung Initiative mixed-ethnicity reference (lower limit of normal [LLN]). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was defined as post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC<LLN among participants with obstruction. Restrictive spirometry pattern was defined as FVC<LLN among participants without obstruction. Multivariable logistic and linear regression was used to identify risk-factors for obstruction, restriction and low lung function despite successful treatment. RESULTS: Of the 172 participants included in the analysis, 82 (48%) were female, 22 (13%) had diabetes and 34 (20%) ever-smoked with a median (IQR) exposure of 3.5 (0.2-9.9) pack-years. Median (IQR) age and body-mass index (BMI) at enrollment was 32 (23-39) years and 18.1 (16.0-20.5) kg/m2 respectively. Airflow obstruction was detected in 42 (24%) participants; of whom 9 (21%) responded to short-acting bronchodilators and 25 (56%) had COPD; and was associated with duration of illness prior to treatment (aOR = 1.32 per 30-days, 95%CI 1.04-1.68, p = 0.02). A restrictive spirometry pattern was detected in 89 (52%) participants and was associated with female sex (aOR = 3.73, 95%CI 1.51-9.17, p = 0.004) and diabetes (aOR = 4.06, 95%CI 1.14-14.42, p = 0.03). Higher HbA1c at treatment initiation was associated with greater odds of a restrictive spirometry pattern (aOR = 1.29 per unit higher HbA1c, 95%CI 1.04 to 1.60, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: We found a high burden of lung function defects and COPD in tuberculosis cases who successfully completed treatment. Screening for chronic lung diseases following treatment and linkage to respiratory health clinics should be included in the routine management plan of all tuberculosis cases in India, regardless of conventional COPD risk-factors such as older age and smoking.</p></div></div></div><h2> - September 2017 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Factors associated with pulmonary impairment in HIV-infected South African adults.</span> (2017).

Studies from developed countries report high viral load, low CD4 counts, and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to be associated with OLD; but these findings may not be generalizable to populations in resource-limited settings. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of lung function in 730 HIV-infected black South African adults. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry was performed at enrollment and repeated annually for three years. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with OLD, defined as FEV1/FVC<0.70, at enrollment. Excess annual declines in FEV1 and FVC were modelled as the product-term of follow-up time and exposures using random effects regression. RESULTS: Median (IQR) age at enrollment was 36 (32-41) years, 85% were female and 30% ever-smoked with a median (IQR) exposure of 3 (1-6) pack-years. Median (IQR) CD4 count and viral load at enrollment were 372 (261-518) cells/mm3 and 2655 (91-13,548) copies/mL respectively. Overall, 25% were receiving ART at enrollment, 16% of whom reported at least 6 months of ART receipt. OLD was found in 35 (5%) at enrollment. Increasing age (aOR = 2.08 per 10-years [95%CI 1.22-3.57], p = 0.007), current smoking (aOR = 3.55 [95%CI 1.20-10.53], p = 0.02), and CRP (aOR = 1.01 per unit-increase [95%CI 1.00-1.03], p = 0.04) were significantly associated with OLD at enrollment; while increasing CD4 count (aOR = 1.02 per-100 cells/mm3 [95%CI 0.85-1.22], p = 0.82), viral load (aOR = 0.67 per log-increase [95%CI 0.43-1.10], p = 0.12) and receipt of ART (aOR = 0.57 [95%CI 0.18-1.75], p = 0.32) were not. The median (IQR) follow-up time was 18 (12-24) months. Participants with a history of tuberculosis (TB) had a 35 mL (95%CI 2-68, p = 0.03) and 57 mL (95%CI 19-96, p = 0.003) per year excess loss of FEV1 and FVC respectively. CONCLUSION: Prevalent OLD was associated with older age, current smoking and higher CRP levels, but not CD4 counts and ART, in HIV-infected South African adults. Better understanding of the long-term effects of TB, smoking and inflammation on lung function in HIV-infected populations is urgently needed.</p></div></div></div><h2> - May 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>The economic case for typhoid conjugate vaccines in countries with medium and high incidence of infection.</span> (2019).

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of micronutrient and inflammation biomarkers to CD4 recovery after cART initiation. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of a random sub-cohort sample (n = 270) from a multinational randomized trial of cART regimen efficacy among 1571 cART-naïve adults. We measured pre-cART serum levels of micronutrients (Vitamin A, B(6), B(12), D, total carotenoids, selenium, and iron) and inflammation (C-reactive protein, soluble CD14 (sCD14), IFNγ, TNFα, Interleukin-6, and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10/IP10), EndoCab (IgM)) biomarkers. Biomarker status (i.e. micronutrient deficiency vs. sufficiency and elevated vs. low inflammation) was defined using established cutoffs or quartiles. Mixed-effects linear regression models were used to determine the association of baseline (pre-cART) concentrations of individual biomarkers with CD4 recovery through 96 weeks post-cART initiation. RESULTS: In models adjusting for time-dependent viral load and baseline CD4 count, age, sex, body mass index, country, treatment regimen, anemia and hypoalbuminemia status, pre-cART vitamin D deficiency was associated with lower CD4 recovery (-14.9 cells/mm(3), 95% CI: -27.9, -1.8) compared to sufficiency. In contrast, baseline selenium deficiency (20.8 cells/mm(3), 95% CI: 3.3, 38.3), vitamin A deficiency (35.9 cells/mm(3), 95% CI: 17.6, 54.3) and high sCD14 (23.4 cells/mm(3), 95% CI: 8.9, 37.8) were associated with higher CD4 recovery compared to sufficient/low inflammation status. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, baseline vitamin D deficiency was associated with diminished CD4 recovery after cART initiation; impaired CD4 recovery may contribute to the poor clinical outcomes recently observed in individuals with vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin A, selenium and sCD14 were associated with CD4 recovery but future studies are needed to further explore these relationships.</p></div></div></div><h2> - December 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Projecting the impact of variable MDR-TB transmission efficiency on long-term epidemic trends in South Africa and Vietnam.</span> (2019).

Even in the absence of a genetic fitness cost, the transmission potential of individuals with MDR-TB may vary by infectiousness, frequency of contact, or duration of disease. We used a compartmental model to project the progression of MDR-TB epidemics in South Africa and Vietnam under alternative assumptions about the relative transmission efficiency of MDR-TB. Specifically, we considered three scenarios: consistently lower transmission efficiency for MDR-TB than for DS-TB; equal transmission efficiency; and an initial deficit in the transmission efficiency of MDR-TB that closes over time. We calibrated these scenarios with data from drug resistance surveys and projected epidemic trends to 2040. The incidence of MDR-TB was projected to expand in most scenarios, but the degree of expansion depended greatly on the future transmission efficiency of MDR-TB. For example, by 2040, we projected absolute MDR-TB incidence to account for 5% (IQR: 4-9%) of incident TB in South Africa and 14% (IQR: 9-26%) in Vietnam assuming consistently lower MDR-TB transmission efficiency, versus 15% (IQR: 8-27%)and 41% (IQR: 23-62%), respectively, assuming shrinking transmission efficiency deficits. Given future uncertainty, specific responses to halt MDR-TB transmission should be prioritized.</p></div></div></div><h2> - August 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Tuberculosis fatality rates in the city of Campinas - São Paulo, Brazil, from 2001 to 2009.</span> (2019).

OBJECTIVE: To analyze TB fatality rates by sex, clinical presentation and HIV coinfection in Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: Cohorts of residents in the city of Campinas who either died during treatment for tuberculosis or had the disease confirmed after death were divided into three intervals: 2001-2003, 2004-2006, and 2007-2009. Data were obtained from the database of the Tuberculosis Surveillance System of the University of Campinas, and notifications were gathered through TB-WEB Health São Paulo Secretary. Statistical significance was determined using a chi-square test, considering p < 0.05. RESULTS: Between 2001 and 2009, 3,416 TB patients were diagnosed: 2,827 (82.8%) were new TB cases and 589 (17.2%) were retreatments. Between the first and second triennium, the number of new patients decreased by 18%, and 23% among retreatments. Between the second and third intervals, the reduction was 5% and 21%, respectively. General case fatality rate declined from 11.4% to 9.9% across intervals, and was most significant among patients that had previously abandoned treatment (17.3% to 5.1%). Fatality rates among patients coinfected with TB-AIDS were 2-3 times that of patients not infected with TB-AIDS throughout the intervals. Fatality between the first and third triennium among TB-AIDS co-infected patients declined (24.8% to 19.5%), while increasing slightly among non-AIDS TB patients (7.3% to 8%) during this period. CONCLUSION: Though mortality among TB-AIDS patients declined from 2001-2009, rates among non-AIDS TB remained stagnant. Improved TB diagnosis and treatment is needed to further decrease TB mortality in Campinas.</p></div></div></div><h2> - January 2018 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Gender-based violence screening methods preferred by women visiting a public hospital in Pune, India.</span> (2018).

Early identification of GBV is crucial for improved health outcomes. Interactions with health care providers may provide a unique opportunity for routine GBV screening, if a safe, confidential environment can be established. METHODS: Between November 2014 and February 2015, a cross-sectional, observational study was conducted where women were interviewed about their opinions concerning GBV screening in a tertiary health care setting in Pune, India. Trained counsellors interviewed 300 women at different out-patient and in-patient departments using a semi-structured questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of these women reported experiencing GBV in their life. However, 90% of women said they had never been asked about GBV in a health care setting. Seventy-two percent expressed willingness to be asked about GBV by their health care providers, with the preferred provider being nurses or counsellors. More than half (53%) women reported face-to-face interview as the most preferred method for screening. There were no major differences in these preferences by GBV history status. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence for preferred GBV screening methods and optimal provider engagement as perceived by women attending a public hospital.</p></div></div></div><h2> - April 2018 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Cost-effectiveness of Preventive Therapy for Tuberculosis With Isoniazid and Rifapentine Versus Isoniazid Alone in High-Burden Settings.</span> (2018).

The contexts in which 3HP may be cost-effective compared to IPT among people living with human immunodeficiency virus are unknown. METHODS: We used a Markov state transition model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of 3HP relative to IPT in high-burden settings, using a cohort of 1000 patients in a Ugandan HIV clinic as an emblematic scenario. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as 2017 US dollars per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted from a healthcare perspective over a 20-year time horizon. We explored the conditions under which 3HP would be considered cost-effective relative to IPT. RESULTS: Per 1000 individuals on antiretroviral therapy in the reference scenario, treatment with 3HP rather than IPT was estimated to avert 9 cases of TB and 1 death, costing $9402 per DALY averted relative to IPT. Cost-effectiveness depended strongly on the price of rifapentine, completion of 3HP, and prevalence of latent TB. At a willingness to pay of $1000 per DALY averted, 3HP is likely to be cost-effective relative to IPT only if the price of rifapentine can be greatly reduced (to approximately $20 per course) and high treatment completion (85%) can be achieved. CONCLUSIONS: 3HP may be a cost-effective alternative to IPT in high-burden settings, but cost-effectiveness depends on the price of rifapentine, achievable completion rates, and local willingness to pay.</p></div></div></div><h2> - February 2018 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Delay in seeking care for tuberculosis symptoms among adults newly diagnosed with HIV in rural Malawi.</span> (2018).

OBJECTIVE: Tuberculosis (TB) is a common initial presentation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We investigated the time from TB symptom onset to HIV diagnosis to describe TB health-seeking behaviour in adults newly diagnosed with HIV. DESIGN: We asked adults (18 years) about the presence and duration of TB symptoms at the time of receiving a new HIV diagnosis. Associations with delayed health seeking (defined as >30 and >90 days from the onset of TB symptoms) were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: TB symptoms were reported by 416 of 1265 participants (33%), of whom 36% (150/416) had been symptomatic for >30 days before HIV testing. Most participants (260/416, 63%) were below the poverty line (US$0.41 per household member per day). Patients who first sought care from informal providers had an increased odds of delay of >30 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.6, 95%CI 0.9-2.8) or 90 days (aOR 2.0, 95%CI 1.1-3.8). CONCLUSIONS: Delayed health seeking for TB-related symptoms was common. Poverty was ubiquitous, but had no clear relationship to diagnostic delay. HIV-positive individuals who first sought care from informal providers were more likely to experience diagnostic delays for TB symptoms.</p></div></div></div><h2> - August 2018 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Inequalities in HAART uptake and differential survival according to exposure category in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</span> (2018).

We assessed the impact of these inequalities on survival in Rio de Janeiro over a 12-year period (2000/11). Data were merged from four databases that comprise the national AIDS monitoring system: SINAN-AIDS (Brazilian Information System for Notificable Diseases; AIDS cases), SISCEL (laboratory tests), SICLOM (electronic dispensing system), and SIM (Brazilian Mortality Information System), using probabilistic linkage. Cox regressions were fitted to assess the impact of HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) on AIDS-related mortality among men who have sex with men (MSM), people who inject drugs (PWID), and heterosexuals diagnosed with AIDS, between 2000 and 2011, in the city of Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil. Among 15,420 cases, 60.7% were heterosexuals, 36.1% MSM and 3.2% PWID. There were 2,807 (18.2%) deaths and the median survival time was 6.29. HAART and CD4+ > 200 at baseline were associated with important protective effects. Non-whites had a 33% higher risk of dying in consequence of AIDS than whites. PWID had a 56% higher risk and MSM a 11% lower risk of dying of AIDS than heterosexuals. Non-white individuals, those with less than eight years of formal education, and PWID, were more likely to die of AIDS and less likely to receive HAART. Important inequalities persist in access to treatment, resulting in disparate impacts on mortality among exposure categories. Despite these persistent disparities, mortality decreased significantly during the period for all categories under analysis, and the overall positive impact of HAART on survival has been dramatic.</p></div></div></div><h2> - January 2017 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Challenges in the Evaluation of Interventions to Improve Engagement Along the HIV Care Continuum in the United States: A Systematic Review.</span> (2017).

We sought to characterize the heterogeneity in research studies and interventions to improve care engagement among people living with diagnosed HIV infection. We performed a systematic literature search for interventions to improve HIV linkage to care, retention in care, reengagement in care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the US published from 2007-mid 2015. Study designs and outcomes were allowed to vary in included studies. We grouped interventions into categories, target populations, and whether results were significantly improved. We identified 152 studies, 7 (5%) linkage studies, 33 (22%) retention studies, 4 (3%) reengagement studies, and 117 (77%) adherence studies. 'Linkage' studies utilized 11 different outcome definitions, while 'retention' studies utilized 39, with very little consistency in effect measurements. The majority (59%) of studies reported significantly improved outcomes, but this proportion and corresponding effect sizes varied substantially across study categories. This review highlights a paucity of assessments of linkage and reengagement interventions; limited generalizability of results; and substantial heterogeneity in intervention types, outcome definitions, and effect measures. In order to make strides against the HIV epidemic in the US, care continuum research must be improved and benchmarked against an integrated, comprehensive framework.</p></div></div></div><h2> - August 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Informing decision-making for universal access to quality tuberculosis diagnosis in India: an economic-epidemiological model.</span> (2019).

Centralized testing at district-level hub facilities with a supporting sample transport network can generate economies of scale, but decentralization to the peripheral level may provide faster diagnosis and reduce losses to follow-up (LTFU). METHODS: We generated functions to evaluate the costs of centralized and decentralized molecular testing for tuberculosis with Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), a WHO-endorsed test which can be performed at centralized and decentralized levels. We merged the cost estimates with an agent-based simulation of TB transmission in a hypothetical representative region in India to assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of each strategy. RESULTS: Compared against centralized Xpert testing, decentralization was most favorable when testing volume at decentralized facilities and pre-treatment LTFU were high, and specimen transport network was exclusively established for TB. Assuming equal quality of centralized and decentralized testing, decentralization was cost-saving, saving a median $338,000 (interquartile simulation range [IQR] - $222,000; $889,000) per 20 million people over 10 years, in the most cost-favorable scenario. In the most cost-unfavorable scenario, decentralized testing would cost a median $3161 [IQR $2412; $4731] per disability-adjusted life year averted relative to centralized testing. CONCLUSIONS: Decentralization of Xpert testing is likely to be cost-saving or cost-effective in most settings to which these simulation results might generalize. More decentralized testing is more cost-effective in settings with moderate-to-high peripheral testing volumes, high existing clinical LTFU, inability to share specimen transport costs with other disease entities, and ability to ensure high-quality peripheral Xpert testing. Decision-makers should assess these factors when deciding whether to decentralize molecular testing for tuberculosis.</p></div></div></div><h2> - June 2017 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Tuberculosis screening among persons with diabetes mellitus in Pune, India.</span> (2017).

Screening for TB among people with DM is now recommended in India. METHODS: People with DM seeking care at a large public sector tertiary care hospital clinic in Pune, India, were screened for TB from June 2015 to May 2016. All consenting people with DM were screened for TB at each clinic visit using a five-item, WHO-recommended questionnaire and those with TB symptoms and/or risk factors were tested for active TB using sputum smear microscopty, Xpert® MTB/RIF and TB culture. Categorical data and continuous variables were summarized using descriptive statistics. The x (2) test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to ascertain significant associations between categorical and continuous variables, respectively. RESULTS: Among 630 adults approached for screening, median age was 60 (interquartile range (IQR), 57-64) years and 350 (56%) were females. Median hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 8.7% (IQR, 6.7-9.9) and 444 (70.5%) were poorly controlled DM (HbA1c > 7). Forty-four (7%) had prior history of TB but the proportion with TB risk factors at screening was low (<5%). While 18% of participants reported any TB symptoms, none of these patients were diagnosed with culture confirmed TB. CONCLUSIONS: Our study failed to yield any active TB cases using a WHO-recommended questionnaire among people with DM. High TB risk populations among people with DM must be identified if TB screening is to be feasible in settings such as India where the DM epidemic continues to rise.</p></div></div></div><h2> - May 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Reply to Chen, Song, and Liu.</span> (2019).

We conducted a discrete choice experiment to quantify service attributes most desired by patients to inform model prioritization. METHODS: Between July and December 2016, a sample of HIV-positive adults on ART at 12 clinics in Zambia were asked to choose between 2 hypothetical facilities that differed across 6 DSD attributes. We used mixed logit models to explore preferences, heterogeneity, and trade-offs. RESULTS: Of 486 respondents, 59% were female and 85% resided in urban locations. Patients strongly preferred infrequent clinic visits [3- vs. 1-month visits: β (ie, relative utility) = 2.84; P < 0.001]. Milder preferences were observed for waiting time for ART pick-up (1 vs. 6 hours.; β = -0.67; P < 0.001) or provider (1 vs. 3 hours.; β = -0.41; P = 0.002); "buddy" ART collection (β = 0.84; P < 0.001); and ART pick-up location (clinic vs. community: β = 0.35; P = 0.028). Urban patients demonstrated a preference for collecting ART at a clinic (β = 1.32, P < 0.001), and although most rural patients preferred community ART pick-up (β = -0.74, P = 0.049), 40% of rural patients still preferred facility ART collection. CONCLUSIONS: Stable patients on ART primarily want to attend clinic infrequently, supporting a focus in Zambia on optimizing multimonth prescribing over other DSD features-particularly in urban areas. Substantial preference heterogeneity highlights the need for DSD models to be flexible, and accommodate both setting features and patient choice in their design.</p></div></div></div><h2> - December 2019 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Clinical impact of rapid drug susceptibility testing to accompany fluoroquinolone-containing universal tuberculosis regimens: a Markov model.</span> (2019).

Appropriate implementation requires evidence-based, context-specific drug-susceptibility testing (DST) strategies. METHODS: We created a Markov state-transition model of 100,000 adults with TB receiving a novel, fluoroquinolone (FQ)-containing regimen. We estimated clinical outcomes and resource utilization with no FQ-DST, universal use of FQ-DST, or FQ-DST only in patients with rifampin-resistant TB ('targeted FQ-DST'). We considered scenarios of stronger (South Africa) and weaker (Southeast Asia) correlation of fluoroquinolone resistance with rifampin resistance. RESULTS: Relative to no FQ-DST, targeted FQ-DST increased cure of FQ-resistant TB by 7.5% (interquartile range 6.7-9.2%) in South Africa and 1.7% (0.7 -2.5%) in Southeast Asia. However, rare FQ resistance among the more-prevalent rifampin-susceptible TB accounted for 50% of FQ-resistant TB in South Africa and 83% in Southeast Asia. As a result, universal FQ-DST further increased cure of FQ-resistant TB by 3.4% (2.3-5.4%) in South Africa and 5.8% (5.1-6.3%) in Southeast Asia. With targeted FQ-DST, one additional patient was cured per 50 (42-70) tests in South Africa and 44 (37-51) in Southeast Asia. When expanding from targeted to universal FQ-DST, one additional cure required 3500 (2300-5500) tests in South Africa and 410 (370-450) in Southeast Asia. The impact of FQ-DST was sensitive to overall treatment effectiveness, regimen robustness to loss of fluoroquinolone activity, and prevalence of both moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide resistance. CONCLUSIONS: FQ-DST improved patient outcomes and was particularly important for high-risk patient groups and less-robust regimens. A universal strategy was favored in generalized epidemics of fluoroquinolone resistance.</p></div></div></div><h2> - January 2018 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Secondhand Smoke Exposure and Validity of Self-Report in Low-Income Women and Children in India.</span> (2018).

We evaluated the validity of standard self-reported measures among women and children in urban India. METHODS: Structured questionnaires were administered, and household air and hair samples were analyzed for nicotine concentration. RESULTS: In total, 141 households of 70 child and 71 adult participants were included. Air nicotine was detected in 72 (51%) homes, and 35 (75%) child and 12 (56%) adult participants had detectable hair nicotine. Correlation between air and hair nicotine was significant in children (r = 0.5; P = .0002) but not in adults (r = -0.1; P = .57). Poor correlation was found between self-reported measures of exposure and both air and hair nicotine. No questions were significantly correlated with hair nicotine, and the highest-magnitude correlation with air nicotine was for how often someone smoked inside for adults (r = 0.4; P = .10) and for home preparation of mishri (a smokeless tobacco product prepared for consumption by roasting) for children (r = 0.4; P = .39). The highest value for sensitivity by using air nicotine as the gold standard was for whether people smelled other families preparing mishri (47%; 95% confidence interval: 31-62) and prepared mishri in their own homes (50%; 95% confidence interval: 19-81). CONCLUSIONS: These results raise caution in using or evaluating self-reported SHS exposure in these communities. More appropriate questions for this population are needed, including mishri preparation as a source of SHS exposure.</p></div></div></div><h2> - October 2015 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Data for action: collection and use of local data to end tuberculosis.</span> (2015).

Successful disease elimination campaigns are characterised by locally tailored responses that are informed by appropriate data. To develop such a response to tuberculosis, we suggest a three-step process that includes improved collection and use of existing programmatic data, collection of additional data (eg, geographic information, drug resistance, and risk factors) to inform tailored responses, and targeted collection of novel data (eg, sequencing data, targeted surveys, and contact investigations) to improve understanding of tuberculosis transmission dynamics. Development of a locally targeted response for tuberculosis will require substantial investment to reconfigure existing systems, coupled with additional empirical data to evaluate the effectiveness of specific approaches. Without adoption of an elimination strategy that uses local data to target hotspots of transmission, ambitious targets to end tuberculosis will almost certainly remain unmet.</p></div></div></div><h2> - November 2018 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Economic and epidemiologic impact of guidelines for early ART initiation irrespective of CD4 count in Spain.</span> (2018).

In January 2016, the Spanish guidelines were updated to recommend ART at any CD4 count. However, the epidemiologic and economic impacts of early ART initiation in Spain remain unclear. METHODS: The Johns Hopkins HIV Economic-Epidemiologic Mathematical Model (JHEEM) was utilized to estimate costs, transmissions, and outcomes in Spain over 20 years. We compared implementation of guidelines for early ART initiation to a counterfactual scenario deferring ART until CD4-counts fall below 350 cells/mm3. We additionally studied the impact of early ART initiation in combination with improvements to HIV screening, care linkage and engagement. RESULTS: Early ART initiation (irrespective of CD4-count) is expected to avert 20,100 [95% Uncertainty Range (UR) 11,100-83,000] new HIV cases over the next two decades compared to delayed ART (28% reduction), at an incremental health system cost of €1.05 billion [€0.66 - €1.63] billion, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €29,700 [€13,700 - €41,200] per QALY gained. Projected ICERs declined further over longer time horizon; e.g., an ICER of €12,691 over 30 years. Furthermore, the impact of early ART initiation was potentiated by improved HIV screening among high-risk individuals, averting an estimated 41,600 [23,200-172,200] HIV infections (a 58% decline) compared to delayed ART. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations for ART initiation irrespective of CD4-counts are cost-effective and could avert > 30% of new cases in Spain. Improving HIV diagnosis can amplify this impact.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract_nav'><p>Page Navigation:</p><a href='publication0.html'>1</a><a href='publication1.html'>2</a><a href='publication2.html'>3</a><a class='current'>4</a><a href='publication4.html'>5</a><a href='publication5.html'>6</a><a href='publication6.html'>7</a><a href='publication7.html'>8</a><a href='publication8.html'>9</a><a href='publication9.html'>10</a></div>
