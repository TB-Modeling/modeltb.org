In South Africa, dry powdered tobacco is inhaled nasally as snuff. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey among PLWH attending three HIV clinics was conducted. Snuff use was assessed via self-report and urine cotinine. RESULTS: Given the low (3%) prevalence of snuff use among men, analysis was restricted to n = 606 nonsmoking women living with HIV. Half (n = 298, 49%) were snuff users, the majority of whom (n = 244, 84%) had a positive urine cotinine test. In adjusted analysis, snuff use was negatively associated with higher education (relative risk [RR] 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.39, 0.77) and mobile phone ownership (RR 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.98), and positively associated with ever having tuberculosis (TB) (RR 1.22; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.45). In adjusted analysis, with current TB as the outcome, snuff use was marginally statistically significantly associated with a twofold increase in odds of a current TB diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 1.99; 95% CI: 0.98, 4.15). DISCUSSION: A high proportion of nonsmoking South African women living with HIV use snuff, which was a risk factor for TB. Additional research is needed to understand the relationship between snuff, TB, and other potential health risks. IMPLICATIONS: PLWH have a higher prevalence of smoking than their seronegative peers, but there is a paucity of research on smokeless tobacco use in this population, especially in low-resource settings. TB is the leading cause of death among PLWH, and with improvements to HIV treatment and care, PLWH are at greater risk of tobacco-related diseases. We report an extremely high prevalence of snuff use among women living with HIV in South Africa. Further, in this population snuff use is positively associated with ever having a TB diagnosis, as well as currently having TB.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>What if They Don't Have Tuberculosis?

Together with imperfect performance and application of existing diagnostic tools, including empirical diagnosis, broader screening risks placing individuals without TB on prolonged treatment. These false-positive diagnoses have profound consequences for TB patients and prevention efforts, yet are usually overlooked in policy decision making. In this article we describe the pathways to a false-positive TB diagnosis, including trade-offs involved in the development and application of diagnostic algorithms. We then consider the wide range of potential consequences for individuals, households, health systems, and reliability of surveillance data. Finally, we suggest practical steps that the TB community can take to reduce the frequency and potential harms of false-positive TB diagnosis and to more explicitly assess the trade-offs involved in the screening and diagnostic process.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Yield of household contact tracing for tuberculosis in rural South Africa.</span> (2018).

Household contact tracing offers a potential approach to diagnose more TB cases, and to do so earlier in the disease course. METHODS: Adults newly diagnosed with active TB were recruited from public clinics in Vhembe District, South Africa. Study staff visited index case households and collected sputum specimens for TB testing via smear microscopy and culture. We calculated the yield and the number of households needed to screen (NHNS) to find one additional case. Predictors of new TB among household contacts were evaluated using multilevel logistic regression. RESULTS: We recruited 130 index cases and 282 household contacts. We identified 11 previously undiagnosed cases of bacteriologically-confirmed TB, giving a prevalence of 3.9% (95% CI: 2.0-6.9%) among contacts, a yield of 8.5 per 100 (95% CI: 4.2-15.1) index cases traced, and NHNS of 12 (95% CI: 7-24). The majority of new TB cases (10/11, 90.9%) were smear negative, culture positive. The presence of TB symptoms was not associated with an increased odds of active TB (aOR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-1.4). CONCLUSIONS: Household contacts of recently diagnosed TB patients in rural South Africa have high prevalence of TB and can be feasibly detected through contact tracing, but more sensitive tests than sputum smear are required. Symptom screening among household contacts had low sensitivity and specificity for active TB in this study.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Maternal priorities for preventive therapy among HIV-positive pregnant women before and after delivery in South Africa: a best-worst scaling survey.</span> (2018).

We quantified changes in priorities related to isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) among pregnant women living with HIV. METHODS: We enrolled pregnant women recently diagnosed with HIV from 14 primary health clinics during pregnancy and followed them after delivery in Matlosana, South Africa. Best-worst scaling (BWS) was used to determine the women's priorities out of 11 attributes related to preventive therapy in the ante- versus postpartum periods. Aggregate BWS scores were calculated based on the frequency with which participants selected each attribute as the best or worst among five options (across multiple choice sets). Individual BWS scores were also calculated and rescaled from 0 (always selected as worst) to 10 (always selected as best), and changes in BWS scores in the ante- versus postpartum periods were compared, using a paired t-test. Factors associated with the changes in BWS scores were examined in multiple linear regressions. Spearman's rho was used to compare the ranking of attributes. RESULTS: Out of a total of 204 participants, 154 (75.5%) completed the survey in the postpartum at the median 15 (IQR: 11 to 27) weeks after delivery. Trust in healthcare providers was most highly prioritized both in the ante- (individual BWS Score = 7.34, SE = 0.13) and postpartum periods (BWS = 7.21 +/- 0.11), followed by living a long life (BWS = 6.77 +/- 0.09 in the ante- vs. BWS = 6.86 +/- 0.10 in the postpartum). Prevention for infants' health was more prioritized in the post- (BWS = 6.54 +/- 0.09) versus antepartum periods (BWS = 6.11 +/- 0.10) (p = 0.05). This change was associated with IPT initiation at enrolment (regression coefficient = 0.78 +/- 0.33, p = 0.001). Difficulty in daily pill-uptake was significantly more prioritized in the postpartum (BWS = 5.03 +/- 0.11) than in the antepartum (BWS = 4.43 +/- 0.10) (p < 0.01). Transportation cost and worry about side effects of pills were least prioritized. Overall ranking of attributes was similar in both time periods (spearman's rho = 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive interventions to build trust in healthcare providers and support adherence may increase uptake of preventive therapy. Counselling needs to emphasize medication benefits for both maternal and infant health among HIV-positive pregnant women.</p></div></div></div><h2> - June 2018 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>A systematic review of the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions among patients with tuberculosis.</span> (2018).

Although smoking cessation is recommended by the World Health Organization and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, there has been no published evaluation of smoking cessation interventions among people with TB. The purpose of this review was to synthesize the evidence on interventions and suggest practice, research and policy implications. A systematic review of the literature identified 14 peer-reviewed studies describing 13 smoking cessation interventions between 2007 and 2017. There were five randomized controlled trials, three non-randomized interventions, and five prospective cohort studies. The primary types of interventions were brief advice (n = 9), behavioral counseling (n = 4), medication (n = 3), and community-based care (n = 3). A variety of health care workers (HCWs) implemented interventions, from physicians, nurses, clinic staff, community health workers (CHWs), as did family members. There was significant heterogeneity of design, definition of smoking and smoking abstinence, and implementation, making comparison across studies difficult. Although all smoking interventions increased smoking cessation between 15% and 82%, many studies had a high risk for bias, including six without a control group. The implementing personnel did not make a large difference in cessation results, suggesting that national TB programs may customize according to their needs and limitations. Family members may be important supporters/advocates for cessation. Future research should standardize definitions of smoking and cessation to allow comparisons across studies. Policy makers should encourage collaboration between tobacco and TB initiatives and develop smoking cessation measures to maximize results in low-resource settings.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Impact of Providing Preexposure Prophylaxis for Human Immunodeficiency Virus at Clinics for Sexually Transmitted Infections in Baltimore City: An Agent-based Model.</span> (2018).

Clinics for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can provide an efficient venue for PrEP delivery. METHODS: To quantify the added value of STI clinic-based PrEP delivery, we used an agent-based simulation of HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM). We simulated the impact of PrEP delivery through STI clinics compared with PrEP delivery in other community-based settings. Our primary outcome was the projected 20-year reduction in HIV incidence among MSM. RESULTS: Assuming PrEP uptake and adherence of 60% each, evaluating STI clinic attendees and delivering PrEP to eligible MSM reduced HIV incidence by 16% [95% uncertainty range, 14%-18%] over 20 years, an impact that was 1.8 (1.7-2.0) times as great as that achieved by evaluating an equal number of MSM recruited from the community. Comparing strategies where an equal number of MSM received PrEP in each strategy (ie, evaluating more individuals for PrEP in the community-based strategy, because MSM attending STI clinics are more likely to be PrEP eligible), the reduction in HIV incidence under the STI clinic-based strategy was 1.3 (1.3-1.4) times as great as that of community-based delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Delivering PrEP to MSM who attend STI clinics can improve efficiency and effectiveness. If high levels of adherence can be achieved in this population, STI clinics may be an important venue for PrEP implementation.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Effect of baseline micronutrient and inflammation status on CD4 recovery post-cART initiation in the multinational PEARLS trial.</span> (2018).

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of micronutrient and inflammation biomarkers to CD4 recovery after cART initiation. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of a random sub-cohort sample (n = 270) from a multinational randomized trial of cART regimen efficacy among 1571 cART-naive adults. We measured pre-cART serum levels of micronutrients (Vitamin A, B6, B12, D, total carotenoids, selenium, and iron) and inflammation (C-reactive protein, soluble CD14 (sCD14), IFNgamma, TNFalpha, Interleukin-6, and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10/IP10), EndoCab (IgM)) biomarkers. Biomarker status (i.e. micronutrient deficiency vs. sufficiency and elevated vs. low inflammation) was defined using established cutoffs or quartiles. Mixed-effects linear regression models were used to determine the association of baseline (pre-cART) concentrations of individual biomarkers with CD4 recovery through 96 weeks post-cART initiation. RESULTS: In models adjusting for time-dependent viral load and baseline CD4 count, age, sex, body mass index, country, treatment regimen, anemia and hypoalbuminemia status, pre-cART vitamin D deficiency was associated with lower CD4 recovery (-14.9 cells/mm(3), 95% CI: -27.9, -1.8) compared to sufficiency. In contrast, baseline selenium deficiency (20.8 cells/mm(3), 95% CI: 3.3, 38.3), vitamin A deficiency (35.9 cells/mm(3), 95% CI: 17.6, 54.3) and high sCD14 (23.4 cells/mm(3), 95% CI: 8.9, 37.8) were associated with higher CD4 recovery compared to sufficient/low inflammation status. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, baseline vitamin D deficiency was associated with diminished CD4 recovery after cART initiation; impaired CD4 recovery may contribute to the poor clinical outcomes recently observed in individuals with vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin A, selenium and sCD14 were associated with CD4 recovery but future studies are needed to further explore these relationships.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Would pan-tuberculosis treatment regimens be cost-effective?</span> (2018).

RESULTS: In 166 homes, the median 24 h average concentration of PM2.5 was 167 mug/m(3) (IQR: 106-294). Although kerosene and wood use were highly prevalent (22% and 25% of homes, respectively), primarily as secondary fuel sources, high PM2.5 concentrations were also found in 95 (57%) homes reporting LPG use alone (mean 141 mug/m(3); IQR: 92-209).

Sputum smear-negative TB patients account for around one-fifth of tuberculosis transmission. The tuberculosis transmission risk of TB patients with negative results on nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) of respiratory specimens has not been established. We sought to estimate the tuberculosis transmission risk of NAAT-negative TB patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed Maryland TB program data collected from 2004 to 2009, during which time NAAT using the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct Test (MTD) was performed routinely. Patients with sputum Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) isolates having matching genotypes were assigned to clusters. Transmission sequence was approximated by collection order of individuals' first culture-positive specimens. Minimum transmission risks of NAAT (MTD)-negative TB patients and of smear-negative TB patients were estimated based on individuals' positions within clusters. Results: Among 809 patients with culture-confirmed TB, M.tb genotypes were available for 782 (96.7%). For NAA-negative TB patients, the minimum transmission risk estimate was 5.1% (95% CI 0-11.4). For smear-negative TB patients, the minimum transmission risk estimate was 11.2% (95% CI 7.2-15.3). Conclusions: Minimum transmission risk of NAAT-negative TB patients was lower than that of smear-negative TB patients. However, transmission risk of NAA-negative TB patients appears to not be negligible.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Relevance and acceptability of using the Quantiferon gold test (QGIT) to screen CD4 blood draws for latent TB infection among PLHIV in South Africa: formative qualitative research findings from the TEKO trial.</span> (2018).

The TEKO trial is assessing the impact of using a blood test, Quantiferon-TB Gold In-Tube Test (QGIT), to screen for latent TB compared to the Tuberculin Screening Test (TST) among PLHIV in South Africa. METHODS: Fifty-six qualitative interviews were conducted with PLHIV and clinical providers participating in the TEKO trial. We explored TB screening, diagnosis, and treatment guidelines and processes and the use of the QGIT to screen for latent TB infection at the time of CD4 blood draw. Thematic content analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Considerable variability in TB screening procedures was documented due to lack of personnel and clarity regarding current national TB guidelines for PLHIV. Few clinics had started using the TST per national guidelines and many patients had never heard of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT). Nearly all participants supported the idea of latent TB screening using routine blood drawn for CD4 counts. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that screening for latent TB infection using QGIT from blood drawn for CD4 counts among PLHIV is an acceptable approach to increase latent TB detection given the challenges associated with ensuring systematic latent TB screening in overburdened public clinics.

The contexts in which 3HP may be cost-effective compared to IPT among people living with human immunodeficiency virus are unknown. Methods: We used a Markov state transition model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of 3HP relative to IPT in high-burden settings, using a cohort of 1000 patients in a Ugandan HIV clinic as an emblematic scenario. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as 2017 US dollars per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted from a healthcare perspective over a 20-year time horizon. We explored the conditions under which 3HP would be considered cost-effective relative to IPT. Results: Per 1000 individuals on antiretroviral therapy in the reference scenario, treatment with 3HP rather than IPT was estimated to avert 9 cases of TB and 1 death, costing $9402 per DALY averted relative to IPT. Cost-effectiveness depended strongly on the price of rifapentine, completion of 3HP, and prevalence of latent TB. At a willingness to pay of $1000 per DALY averted, 3HP is likely to be cost-effective relative to IPT only if the price of rifapentine can be greatly reduced (to approximately $20 per course) and high treatment completion (85%) can be achieved. Conclusions: 3HP may be a cost-effective alternative to IPT in high-burden settings, but cost-effectiveness depends on the price of rifapentine, achievable completion rates, and local willingness to pay.</p></div></div></div><h2> - March 2018 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>The effect of partner HIV status on motivation to take antiretroviral and isoniazid preventive therapies: a conjoint analysis.</span> (2018).

The successful uptake of ART and IPT requires a comprehensive understanding of patients' motivation to take such therapies. Partners also play an important role in the decision to be initiated and retained in care. We quantified patients' motivation to take preventive therapies (ART and IPT) and compared by partner HIV status among people newly diagnosed of HIV. We enrolled and surveyed adults (>/=18 years) with a recent HIV diagnosis (<6 months) from 14 public primary care clinics in Matlosana, South Africa. Participants received eight forced-choice tasks comparing two mutually exclusive sub-sets of seven possible benefits related to preventive therapies. A linear probability model was fitted to estimate the probability of prioritizing each benefit. Tests of concordance were conducted across partner HIV status (no partner, HIV- or unknown, or HIV+). A total of 424 people completed surveys. At the time of interview, 272 (64%) were on ART and 334 (79%) had a partner or spouse. Keeping themselves healthy for their family was the most important motivator to take preventive therapies (p < 0.001). Preventing HIV transmission to partners was also highly prioritized among participants with current partners independent of partner's HIV status (p < 0.001), but it was least prioritized among those without current partners (p = 0.72). Keeping themselves healthy was less prioritized. We demonstrate that social responsibility such as supporting family and preventing HIV transmission to partners may pose greater motivation for ART and IPT initiation and adherence compared to individual health benefits. These messages should be emphasized to provide effective patient-centered care and counseling.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Predictors of isoniazid preventive therapy completion among adults newly diagnosed with HIV in rural Malawi.</span> (2018).

Completion of IPT remains a major challenge in resource-limited settings. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate predictors of IPT completion in individuals newly diagnosed with HIV. DESIGN: Predictors of IPT completion among adults newly diagnosed with HIV in rural Malawi were evaluated using a multilevel logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of 974 participants who screened negative for active TB and were started on IPT, 732 (75%) completed treatment. Only one IPT-eligible individual refused treatment. Participants who were aged <25 years (compared with those aged >/=45 years, adjusted OR [aOR] 0.33, 95%CI 0.18-0.60) and male (compared to non-pregnant females, aOR 0.57, 95%CI 0.37-0.88) had lower odds of IPT completion. CONCLUSION: IPT provision at the time of initial HIV diagnosis was highly acceptable in rural Malawi; three quarters of those who initiated IPT successfully completed therapy. We observed lower odds of completion among males and among female participants aged <25 years. Additional efforts may be needed to ensure IPT completion among males and young females who have recently been diagnosed with HIV.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Of Testing and Treatment: Implications of Implementing New Regimens for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis.</span> (2018).

However, the most appropriate use of drug susceptibility testing (DST) to support this regimen is less clear. Implementing countries must therefore often choose between using a standardized regimen despite high levels of underlying drug resistance or require more stringent DST prior to treatment initiation. The former carries a high likelihood of exposing patients to de facto monotherapy with a critical drug class (fluoroquinolones), whereas the latter could exclude large groups of patients from their most effective treatment option. We discuss the implications of this dilemma and argue for an approach that will integrate DST into the delivery of any novel antimicrobial regimen, without excessively stringent requirements. Such guidance could make the novel MDR tuberculosis regimen available to most patients while reducing the risk of generating additional drug resistance.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Tuberculosis Mortality in the United States: Epidemiology and Prevention Opportunities.</span> (2018).

Objective(s) To identify risk factors for tuberculosis-related death in adults. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 1,304 adults with tuberculosis who died before treatment completion and 1,039 frequency-matched controls who completed tuberculosis treatment in 2005-2006 in thirteen states reporting 65% of U.S. tuberculosis cases. We used in-depth record abstractions and a standard algorithm to classify deaths in persons with tuberculosis as tuberculosis-related or not. We then compared these classifications to causes of death as coded in death certificates. We used multivariable logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for predictors of tuberculosis-related death among adults compared with those who completed tuberculosis treatment. RESULTS: Of 1,304 adult deaths, 942 (72%) were tuberculosis-related, 272 (21%) were not, and 90 (7%) couldn't be classified. Of 847 tuberculosis-related deaths with death certificates available, 378 (45%) did not list tuberculosis as a cause of death. Adjusting for known risks, we identified new risks for tuberculosis-related death during treatment: absence of pyrazinamide in the initial regimen (aOR=3.4, 95% CI=1.9-6.0); immunosuppressive medications (aOR=2.5, 95% CI=1.1-5.6); incomplete TB diagnostic evaluation (aOR=2.2, 95% CI=1.5-3.3), and an alternative non-TB diagnosis prior to TB diagnosis (aOR=1.6, 95% CI=1.2-2.2). Conclusions Most persons who died with tuberculosis had a tuberculosis-related death. Intensive record review revealed tuberculosis as a cause of death more often than did death certificate diagnoses. New tools, such as a TB mortality risk score based on our study findings, may identify TB patients for in-hospital interventions to prevent death.</p></div></div></div><h2> - February 2018 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Delay in seeking care for tuberculosis symptoms among adults newly diagnosed with HIV in rural Malawi.</span> (2018).

OBJECTIVE: Tuberculosis (TB) is a common initial presentation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We investigated the time from TB symptom onset to HIV diagnosis to describe TB health-seeking behaviour in adults newly diagnosed with HIV. DESIGN: We asked adults (>/=18 years) about the presence and duration of TB symptoms at the time of receiving a new HIV diagnosis. Associations with delayed health seeking (defined as >30 and >90 days from the onset of TB symptoms) were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: TB symptoms were reported by 416 of 1265 participants (33%), of whom 36% (150/416) had been symptomatic for >30 days before HIV testing. Most participants (260/416, 63%) were below the poverty line (US$0.41 per household member per day). Patients who first sought care from informal providers had an increased odds of delay of >30 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.6, 95%CI 0.9-2.8) or 90 days (aOR 2.0, 95%CI 1.1-3.8). CONCLUSIONS: Delayed health seeking for TB-related symptoms was common. Poverty was ubiquitous, but had no clear relationship to diagnostic delay. HIV-positive individuals who first sought care from informal providers were more likely to experience diagnostic delays for TB symptoms.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>What Will It Take to Reduce HIV Incidence in the United States: A Mathematical Modeling Analysis.</span> (2018).

However, there is a paucity of usable program-level benchmarks tied to population-level epidemiologic goals. Our objective was to define tangible benchmarks for annual rates along the care continuum that are likely to translate to meaningful reductions in incidence. Methods: We used a validated mathematical model of HIV transmission and care engagement to characterize care continuum parameters that would translate into 50% reductions in incidence by 2025, compared with a base case scenario of the current US care continuum. We generated a large pool of simulations in which rates of screening, linkage, and retention in care were varied across wide ranges to evaluate permutations that halved incidence by 2025. Results: Among all simulations, 7% achieved a halving of incidence. It was impossible for our simulations to achieve this target if the annual rate of disengagement from care exceeded 20% per year, even at high rates of care reengagement. When retention in care was 95% per year and people living with HIV (PLWH) out of care reengaged within 1.5 years (on average), the probability of halving incidence by 2025 was approximately 90%. Conclusions: HIV programs should aim to retain at least 95% of PLWH in care annually and reengage people living with HIV into care within an average of 1.5 years to achieve the goal of halving HIV incidence by 2025.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Risk factors associated with cluster size of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) of different RFLP lineages in Brazil.</span> (2018).

We determined the risk factors associated with cluster size of IS6110 RFLP based genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates from Vitoria, Espirito Santo, Brazil. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of new TB cases identified in the metropolitan area of Vitoria, Brazil between 2000 and 2010. Mtb isolates were genotyped by the IS6110 RFLP, spoligotyping and RD(Rio). The isolates were classified according to genotype cluster sizes by three genotyping methods and associated patient epidemiologic characteristics. Regression Model was performed to identify factors associated with cluster size. RESULTS: Among 959 Mtb isolates, 461 (48%) cases had an isolate that belonged to an RFLP cluster, and six clusters with ten or more isolates were identified. Of the isolates spoligotyped, 448 (52%) were classified as LAM and 412 (48%) as non-LAM. Our regression model found that 6-9 isolates/RFLP cluster were more likely belong to the LAM family, having the RD(Rio) genotype and to be smear-positive (adjusted OR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.08-1.26; adjusted OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.14-1.37; crude OR = 2.68, 95% IC 1.13-6.34; respectively) and living in a Serra city neighborhood decrease the risk of being in the 6-9 isolates/RFLP cluster (adjusted OR = 0.29, 95% CI, 0.10-0.84), than in the others groups. Individuals aged 21 to 30, 31 to 40 and > 50 years were less likely of belonging the 2-5 isolates/RFLP cluster than unique patterns compared to individuals < 20 years of age (adjusted OR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.28-0.85, OR = 0.43 95% CI 0.24-0.77and OR = 0. 49, 95% CI 0.26-0.91), respectively. The extrapulmonary disease was less likely to occur in those infected with strains in the 2-5 isolates/cluster group (adjustment OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.24-0.85) than unique patterns. CONCLUSIONS: We found that a large proportion of new TB infections in Vitoria is caused by prevalent Mtb genotypes belonging to the LAM family and RD(Rio) genotypes. Such information demonstrates that some genotypes are more likely to cause recent transmission. Targeting interventions such as screening in specific areas and social risk groups, should be a priority for reducing transmission.</p></div></div></div><h2> - January 2018 - </h2><div class='abstract'><p><span class='b'>Gender-based violence screening methods preferred by women visiting a public hospital in Pune, India.</span> (2018).

Early identification of GBV is crucial for improved health outcomes. Interactions with health care providers may provide a unique opportunity for routine GBV screening, if a safe, confidential environment can be established. METHODS: Between November 2014 and February 2015, a cross-sectional, observational study was conducted where women were interviewed about their opinions concerning GBV screening in a tertiary health care setting in Pune, India. Trained counsellors interviewed 300 women at different out-patient and in-patient departments using a semi-structured questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of these women reported experiencing GBV in their life. However, 90% of women said they had never been asked about GBV in a health care setting. Seventy-two percent expressed willingness to be asked about GBV by their health care providers, with the preferred provider being nurses or counsellors. More than half (53%) women reported face-to-face interview as the most preferred method for screening. There were no major differences in these preferences by GBV history status. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence for preferred GBV screening methods and optimal provider engagement as perceived by women attending a public hospital.</p></div></div></div><div class='abstract_nav'><p>Page Navigation:</p><a href='publication0.html'>1</a><a href='publication1.html'>2</a><a href='publication2.html'>3</a><a class='current'>4</a><a href='publication4.html'>5</a><a href='publication5.html'>6</a><a href='publication6.html'>7</a><a href='publication7.html'>8</a><a href='publication8.html'>9</a><a href='publication9.html'>10</a></div>
